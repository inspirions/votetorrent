# run-recovery-branch-proof.sh
#
# Purpose : D-26a leg 5 — the LOCAL half. Drives the recovery-key signing branch on a real
#           device with NO network, NO relay and NO drone, and asserts the resulting P-256
#           signature is accepted by `verifySigP256` — the same function the schema's
#           `SignatureValidP256` CHECK calls.
#
#           D-26a as originally specified is folded into D-24 leg 3's revoke-then-add ceremony,
#           whose success criterion is a replacement key landing in the network `UserKey` table.
#           That needs a network whose `User` resolves with BOTH keys registered — a precondition
#           blocked behind an unrelated P2P/relay chain. The branch itself needs none of that.
#
#           Split:
#             LOCAL (this script) — the branch runs, signs, and the schema's verifier accepts it.
#             DEFERRED           — UserKey.DeleteValid/InsertValid accept the revoke+add round
#                                  trip. Genuinely network-dependent; rides along whenever a
#                                  network next exists on the device.
#
#           Does NOT close D-24 leg 3. Record it as D-26a-LOCAL.
#
# BRANCH ATTRIBUTION IS MEASURED, NOT INFERRED
#           The existing `recover` leg's `recover-branch` sub-assertion records PASS for SDK<30 on
#           "source-guaranteed" dispatch — it captures the logcat but never gates on it, so it
#           would print PASS on a device where the KeyguardManager path never executed. Below API
#           30 that path launches `KeyguardManager.createConfirmDeviceCredentialIntent` via
#           `startActivityForResult`; an OS activity launch is visible in logcat independently of
#           anything the app logs. This script GATES on that, and on API 30+ gates on its ABSENCE
#           (the BiometricPrompt path starts no such activity). That is the fix for the soft
#           assertion.
#
# Usage   : SERIAL=<serial> ./scripts/run-recovery-branch-proof.sh
#           Requires a human at the device: the prompt must be satisfied with the DEVICE
#           CREDENTIAL (PIN/pattern/password), never a fingerprint.
#
# Exit    : 0 — verdict PASS and the branch assertion held
#           1 — verdict FAIL, timeout, or branch assertion failed
#

/**
 * lint-copy.mjs — the D-06 three-root copy-discipline gate; the repo-root
 * `lint:copy` script (and the dashboard's own `lint` delegates to it).
 *
 * Relocated (53-10) from the dashboard workspace's own former single-root
 * script, at the file this replaced -- see this plan's SUMMARY for the exact
 * prior path, deliberately not restated here so this comment does not itself
 * become a dangling reference once that file is gone. That single-root
 * script proved only the dashboard's own `src/` clean; the
 * shared copy table (`packages/ui-web/src/copy.js`) now serves THREE roots —
 * `packages/ui-web/src`, `apps/VoteTorrentDashboard/src` and
 * `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/src` — and a lint that only ever looked at one of
 * them proves nothing about the other two. D-06's reasoning, in its own
 * words: a lint that cannot detect a violation in a root proves nothing
 * about that root. A single global positive control satisfies the letter of
 * "positive-control-first" and defeats its purpose — it proves the matcher
 * FUNCTIONS, not that the matcher was ever POINTED AT a given root. So the
 * positive control (and its inertness counterpart) below is replicated once
 * PER ROOT, rather than run once globally: `packages/ui-web/src`,
 * `apps/VoteTorrentDashboard/src` and `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/src` each get
 * their own existence check, their own reachability check, their own
 * positive control and their own inertness control, and each prints its own
 * `OK` line — a root that goes empty or silently drops off the list is
 * visible in stdout rather than inferred from an unchanged exit code.
 *
 * Enforces that every user-facing string lives in EXACTLY ONE table
 * (`packages/ui-web/src/copy.js`) and that the table itself obeys the
 * standing rules: frozen, non-empty string values, no GSD phase number or
 * decision ID, and no `read-only` panel-state string (contract C3 /
 * Phase 50's D-17 — a different rule from this phase's own D-17, which is
 * about test-only fixtures; qualified here so the two are never conflated).
 *
 * The copy table is imported by an absolute `file://` URL built from the
 * 53-01 resolver (`moduleUrl(uiWebSrc('copy.js'))`), never by the bare
 * `@votetorrent/ui-web` specifier: measured at HEAD, a bare `@votetorrent/*`
 * specifier does not resolve from the repo root (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` —
 * `.yarnrc.yml` sets `nmHoistingLimits: workspaces` and the repo root
 * declares no `@votetorrent/*` dependency, so no root `node_modules/@votetorrent`
 * exists at all). Carrying a bare specifier here would make this gate's
 * verdict depend on the directory it was launched from, which is exactly
 * what the byte-identical-stdout property below rules out.
 *
 * The one relative import below, `./lib/source-paths.mjs`, is repo-local
 * tooling, not a package dependency — this script still has NO DEPENDENCIES
 * beyond `node:` builtins, a dynamic `import()` of `copy.js` itself, and that
 * one sibling module. It replaces every derivation this script used to make
 * from the process's own launch directory: `scripts/lib/source-paths.mjs`
 * exists specifically because a script that derives its own root cannot
 * relocate safely, and this file is the relocation `53-01` was landed ahead
 * of. Adding a fourth `@votetorrent/ui-web` consumer means adding its `src/`
 * to the `ROOTS` list below — see the repo-root dedupe-and-gate assertion
 * that enumerates consumers for the sibling half of that same rule.
 *
 * Runs its own positive controls FIRST — a lint that cannot detect a
 * violation proves nothing. Standalone Node script, NO DEPENDENCIES beyond
 * `node:` builtins and a dynamic `import()` of `copy.js` itself — no parser
 * package, no AST library. The JSX-prose scanner below is a REGEX-based
 * JSX-text-node scanner, deliberately: it catches the CLASS of violation (a
 * newly hard-coded English phrase in a JSX text node), not a fixed list of
 * sentinel strings, while staying dependency-free.
 *
 * THE MATCHER'S REAL BOUNDARY (a regex scanner is not total, and pretending
 * otherwise is worse than documenting the gap): it scans one SOURCE LINE at a
 * time, so it does not see a JSX text node that itself wraps onto a second
 * line. It looks only at text between `>` and `<` — so an ATTRIBUTE value
 * (`title={...}`, `aria-label="..."`) is never inspected, by construction,
 * because an attribute sits BEFORE the `>` that closes its tag. A template
 * literal INSIDE an expression container (`{`\`tier ${n}\`}`) is invisible
 * too — the container is stripped as a unit before the text is checked, the
 * same as `{t('key')}` is. None of these are a defect to "fix" by widening
 * the regex; each would reopen exactly the false-positive class (a TS
 * generic argument such as `useState<string | undefined>(undefined)` reading
 * as JSX text) that made a naive whole-file regex unusable before this
 * scanner was scoped to one line at a time.

#
# Purpose : Phase 61 D-02 Tier-2 on-device geometry proof for the Voter app's election
#           timeline. Measures REAL rendered pixel geometry pulled from a `uiautomator`
#           view-tree dump -- a class of defect (clipped text, duplicate action labels,
#           undersized touch targets) that no Jest `onLayout`-based assertion can see,
#           because `react-test-renderer` never runs a Yoga layout pass. Every rendering
#           claim in this phase has to cite a Tier-2 result, and this script is the
#           Tier-2 surface (D-02).
#
# Usage   : SERIAL=43a209ff0806 LOCALE=en ./scripts/run-timeline-geometry-proof.sh <leg>
#           <leg> one of: clipping | duplicates | touch-targets | all
#           --selftest              host-only, no device required: proves the parser
#                                    against four committed fixtures under
#                                    scripts/lib/__fixtures__/timeline-geometry/
#           --dump-records <xml>    host-only, no device required: prints the normalized
#                                    CARD/TEXT/CLICK/ORPHAN record stream for one XML file
#                                    and exits (debugging surface / --selftest internals)
#
# Prereqs : adb on PATH for the device legs (clipping|duplicates|touch-targets|all) --
#           NOT required for --selftest or --dump-records, which read only committed
#           fixtures / a given file. A booted, USB-debug-enabled device running the
#           debug build of org.votetorrent.voter is required for the device legs.
#
#           REQUIRED APP STATE (IN-06) -- the device legs do NOT navigate for you:
#             * the app must already be on the TIMELINE tab,
#             * scrolled to the TOP (collect_records() only ever swipes DOWNWARD),
#             * showing the locale named by LOCALE (the preflight cross-checks the live
#               dump for 'Voting Period' / 'Período de Votación'),
#             * with the votingStarts row reachable.
#           Starting anywhere else fails the locale cross-check below, which historically
#           read like a locale bug when it was really "you are on the wrong screen".
#
# Exit    : 0 -- every selected leg printed LEG <name>: PASS (or --selftest /
#               --dump-records completed successfully)
#           1 -- a preflight failed, any selected leg printed LEG <name>: FAIL, or
#               --selftest / --dump-records failed
#
# Verdict : a DEVICE run prints `LEG <name>: PASS|FAIL (<evidence>)`; --selftest prints
# lines     `SELFTEST-LEG <name>: ...` and `RECORDS-CASE <name>: ...` instead (IN-03). The two
#           are deliberately NOT interchangeable: a healthy --selftest emits many FAIL lines --
#           rejecting a broken fixture is what passing looks like -- and they carry the same
#           `locale=... serial=...` tail a device line does. Cite `LEG ` only for device
#           evidence; a `SELFTEST-LEG ` line proves the instrument, never the product.
#
# Note    : this script emits no ANSI colour codes in its own output. A future CI-style
#           consumer piping `LEG ` lines through a line-anchored parser must not assume a
#           colour-stripping step exists upstream -- this project has hit the
#           FORCE_COLOR=3 trap before on OTHER scripts' jest/tsc output (agent shells set
#           it, defeating naive `^...$` parsers); this script simply never emits ANSI in
#           the first place, so there is nothing to strip.

# (`cleanup(){ local rc=$?; rm -rf ...; exit "$rc"; }`) was tried first and empirically
# does NOT work on this repo's bash (3.2, macOS stock): verified live that `$?` as read
# from *inside* an EXIT trap is already 0 by the time the trap body runs when the trap was
# entered via a `set -u` unbound-variable abort specifically (as opposed to an explicit
# `exit N` call, which correctly threads through even without this fix) -- there is no
#"real" nonzero status left to capture at that point on this bash version. Used a
# fail-closed flag instead: default SCRIPT_EXIT_CODE to 1 (failure) up front, and only the
# three genuinely-successful exit points in this file (the two host-only --selftest /
# --dump-records completions and the final all-legs-passed line) flip it to 0 immediately

  # device output; see todos/pending/2026-09-16-timeline-geometry-proof-dump-ui-status-
  # unbound-and-exit-masked.md). collect_records() appends one ORPHAN record for a stage the
  # FIRST time any single pass observes that stage's title/subtitle/action content without
  # its notch co-resolving IN THAT SAME PASS (e.g. only two cards fit the viewport at once,
  # so a card's tail can be visible a pass before/after its own notch scrolls into frame).
  # That ORPHAN record was never retired even when a DIFFERENT pass in the very same
  # 8-iteration loop captured the stage's CARD (notch + bounds) correctly -- a real, valid
  # observation sitting in the same ACCUMULATED_RECORDS file. A stage with a CARD record
  # from ANY pass has, by definition, had its notch anchor positively resolved at least
  # once; an ORPHAN record for that same stage is then a stale artifact of a different
  # pass's transitional/boundary state, not evidence the anchor never resolves. Drop such
  # stale ORPHAN lines before anything downstream (this preflight check, or any leg) reads
  # the file. This can only ever REMOVE an ORPHAN line for a stage independently proven
  # present via its own CARD record -- it cannot manufacture a CARD record, and a stage
  # that truly has no CARD record in any pass is untouched by this filter and continues to
  # fail (via the "could not locate card anchor" check immediately below, which reads
  # CARD records only and was never affected by this bug) -- exactly the genuine
  # scroll-boundary case that must stay a real, reported failure.
  #
  # WR-06: the awk that does this used to be inlined right here, on the DEVICE-ONLY path --
  # --selftest goes straight from walk_dump() to run_leg() and never calls preflight() or

  # either the has_card build or the ORPHAN test) would silently drop EVERY orphan and make
  # `anchor-missing` unreachable on the only path that checks it. It now lives in

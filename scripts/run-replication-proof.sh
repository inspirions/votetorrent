# run-replication-proof.sh
#
# Purpose  : P2P-06 symmetric replication proof.
#            Step 1 — Peer A (emulator-5554) boots FIRST solo in bootstrap mode
#            (no drone, no peer). Its replication-proof-runner creates the proof
#            strand and logs [replication-proof] strandId=<hash>.
#            Step 2 — The script captures the hash and launches the drone (Node 22)
#            with STRAND_ID=<hash>; the drone's READY ws multiaddr is injected into
#            the generated config so the runner connects automatically (D-07).
#            Step 3/4 — Both peers are force-stopped, logcat cleared, then relaunched
#            networked for the real symmetric proof run.
#            D-05 (peerId stability): captured before/after a Peer-A relaunch within
#            the networked run; asserts equality.
#            D-06 (peers>=1): the peers= marker is polled and its count asserted.
#            D-01 (both-PASS): BOTH emulators must emit REPLICATION VERDICT: PASS.
#
# Usage    : ./scripts/run-replication-proof.sh
#            Env vars (all optional):
#              FRESH_EMULATOR=1|0  — (default 1) wipe both emulators to a clean app
#                                    slate (pm clear + a votetorrent-* LevelDB store
#                                    wipe, D-11 idiom) before Step 1. Set to 0 to skip
#                                    (e.g. re-running immediately after a clean pass).
#
# 38-07 (route-forward from 38-05, all 8 prior runs died at a force-stop/relaunch
# marker-timeout checkpoint): checkpoint marker timeouts are raised (see
# MARKER_TIMEOUT/STRAND_TIMEOUT/DRONE_READY_TIMEOUT below), the D-05 Peer-A relaunch
# and the networked both-peer relaunch route through a local `relaunch_and_wait`
# helper that retries the force-stop/relaunch once (2 attempts total) on a transient
# marker miss instead of `set -e`-aborting the whole run, and the run starts from the
# FRESH_EMULATOR precondition above.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - adb must be in PATH (Android SDK Platform Tools)
#   - Both emulators (emulator-5554 and emulator-5556) must be running and the
#     app (org.votetorrent.authority) must be installed on each.
#   - nvm must be available with Node 22 (drone.mjs requires Promise.withResolvers).
#   - The drone and CONTROL_ADDR injection are now automated — no manual steps needed.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — REPLICATION VERDICT: PASS (both peers) — both emulators passed
#   1  — REPLICATION VERDICT: FAIL, missing strandId/READY addr, D-05 mismatch,
#         D-06 peer count < 1, or no verdict within timeout (incl. after both
#         relaunch_and_wait attempts miss their marker)

PACKAGE="org.votetorrent.authority"

# 38-07: local relaunch-retry helper — kept in THIS script (not logcat-wait.sh,
# which run-vtest02.sh also sources; editing the shared helper risks a D-11
# solo/strand regression). All 8 prior 38-05 runs died at a force-stop/relaunch
# marker-timeout checkpoint (`set -e`-abort on the FIRST miss). This wraps a
# force-stop + logcat-clear + relaunch + wait_for_logcat_line cycle under a
# temporarily relaxed `set +e` so a transient marker-timeout returns non-zero
# instead of aborting, then retries the whole cycle once more (2 attempts total)
# before giving up.
#
# Usage: relaunch_and_wait SERIAL PATTERN TIMEOUT_S WHAT [SECOND_SERIAL]
#   SERIAL         — the adb serial whose marker is waited on (e.g. emulator-5554)
#   PATTERN        — logcat pattern passed to wait_for_logcat_line
#   TIMEOUT_S      — seconds to wait per attempt
#   WHAT           — human label for wait_for_logcat_line's own error messages
#   SECOND_SERIAL  — optional: also force-stop/clear/relaunch this serial on every
#                    attempt (the networked both-peer relaunch needs both devices up
#                    together before either's marker is meaningful), but only SERIAL's
#                    marker is waited on.
#
# Echoes the matched logcat line to stdout (same contract as wait_for_logcat_line);
# prints nothing (empty) if both attempts miss — callers must check for an empty
# result exactly as they already do for a bare wait_for_logcat_line call.

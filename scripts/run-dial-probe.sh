# run-dial-probe.sh
#
# Purpose  : P2P-01 dial proof — proves a device→host WebSocket dial completes
#            without a "connection gater denied" error, validating the cadre-core
#            connectionGater yarn patch authored in Phase 17.
#
# Usage    : ./scripts/run-dial-probe.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - adb must be in PATH (Android SDK Platform Tools)
#   - A real device or AVD (Pixel_8) must be connected and recognised by adb
#   - The app (org.votetorrent.authority) must be installed on the device
#   - The host drone must already be running BEFORE this script is called:
#       yarn install   # once, at the repo root (p2p-probe-host is a yarn workspace)
#       cd packages/p2p-probe-host && nvm use 22 && node drone.mjs   # keep running in a separate terminal
#   - CONTROL_ADDR in apps/VoteTorrentAuthority/src/engines/dial-probe.ts must be
#     updated with the port and peerId printed by the drone on startup.
#     Re-build and hot-reload (or bundle rebuild) the app after updating CONTROL_ADDR.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — [dial-probe] DIAL VERDICT: PASS captured from logcat (conn >= 1)
#   1  — [dial-probe] DIAL VERDICT: FAIL captured, or no verdict within the timeout
#
# Failure modes:
#   ECONNREFUSED / ETIMEDOUT  — drone not running or CONTROL_ADDR wrong (not a gater failure)
#   "connection gater denied" — patch not applied or gater not forwarded into libp2p
#

#
# Purpose  : VTEST-02 — Automated full-chain restart-persistence proof for VoteTorrentAuthority.
#            Force-stops the app, relaunches it via adb, then polls logcat for the verdict
#            that the in-app persistence-proof-runner.ts emits once the read phase completes.
#
# Usage    : ./scripts/run-vtest02.sh [--solo]
#            Bare invocation  : strand-on (default) — flips STRAND_PERSISTENCE_PROOF_ENABLED=true,
#                                resets BOTH the votetorrent-q2-* and votetorrent-cadre-probe-persistence*
#                                LevelDB stores, exercises the strand path (D-05b).
#            --solo           : STRAND off — writes STRAND_PERSISTENCE_PROOF_ENABLED=false (keeps
#                                PROOF_ENABLED=true), skips the strand-store reset, and exercises the
#                                solo rnDbFactory path only (D-15 solo regression gate).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - adb must be in PATH (Android SDK Platform Tools)
#   - A real device or AVD must be connected and recognised by adb
#   - The app (org.votetorrent.authority) must be installed on the device
#   - The app must already be in "write-complete" state: run the app once so the write phase
#     executes and persists the full-chain reference under PROOF_CHAIN_REF_KEY in AsyncStorage;
#     then force-stop manually (or let this script do the first force-stop).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — FULL-CHAIN VERDICT: PASS captured from logcat
#   1  — FULL-CHAIN VERDICT: FAIL captured, or no verdict within the timeout
#

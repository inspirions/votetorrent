# VoteTorrent Technical Architecture

## Overall Requirements

* Election authority can advertise and revise election including timeframes and keyholders
* The list of registered voters could be fixed at start of election, or grow until closing
* District authorities can publish and revise ballot templates
* Registrant maintains a public and private key - private key is optimally held in a hardware vault
* Registrant detail may be comprised of public and private attributes, neither of which can be tampered with without detection
* Authority may retain actual private information on voters, but any tampering will change the hash and be detected
* The stakeholders can see public portion (if any) of voter registration
* Voter can vote without the authority, peers, or any other party knowing for which candidate
* Revealing election results requires at least the election's threshold k of its n keyholders to publish their key shares during the appointed timeframe; fewer than k shares reveal nothing
* Voter can verify presence and correctness of his or her vote
* Stakeholders can verify that only eligible voters voted
* Stakeholders can verify the final tally
* Stakeholders can tell which voters voted, but not what for
* No party should be able to vote on behalf of the voter - there may be restrictions on how far this is possible
* All voters may participate in validation of election results, and such validation results are made available to stakeholders

## Subsystems

![Subsystems](figures/subsystems.png)

* **Directory Network ("Directory")**

  * Interface: Rest API

## Peer to Peer Networks

The heart of VoteTorrent is the peer-to-peer network, which is based on the Kademlia DHT.  A Kademlia DHT is a distributed hash table that allows nodes to find each other and exchange information.

Each network varies in terms of what specific information is stored and exchanged, but the core protocols are the same.  The core protocols of VoteTorrent networks are:
* **Distributed Database System - Optimystic** - the network cooperatively acts as a database, holding collections of elections, registration, voting, validation, or whatever is being tracked by that network.  
* **Peer-to-peer matchmaking** - efficiently find other peers who are interested in performing cooperative tasks, such as forming a voting block.

## Distributed Database System - Optimystic

The Optimystic system uses a logical transaction log combined with block-based storage to provide a distributed database system. This scheme can be used standalone or coupled with tree or other data structures, supporting both single-collection and cross-collection transactions through a multi-phase process for propagating updates, committing transactions, and checkpointing affected blocks.

For details, see [optimystic](optimystic.md).

## Matchmaking

VoteTorrent's peer-to-peer network employs a rendezvous-based matchmaking system to efficiently connect peers for various tasks, regardless of network size or task popularity. The core concept involves nodes meeting at localized rendezvous points, with rendezvous keys derived from a combination of local node address information and task-specific hashes. Peers can adjust the specificity of these keys based on their local Kademlia bucket distribution and network conditions, allowing for adaptive control over the search and matchmaking process.

The matchmaking process differs for active matchers and waiting workers. Active matchers generate rendezvous keys, publish their intent, search for matches, and adjust key specificity as needed to find suitable peers quickly. Workers, on the other hand, register their availability with longer Time-To-Live (TTL) values and wait for work assignments, adjusting their specificity to balance the load at rendezvous points. This flexible system can handle various scenarios, from sparse networks with few interested peers to dense networks with many participants, by dynamically adjusting the rendezvous key specificity to optimize peer discovery and work distribution.

For details, see [matchmaking](matchmaking.md).

## Election Logic

Election structures are stored using the Optimystic distributed database system.  Vote blocks are appended to the vote tree collection, and a pointer to the block is noted in the registration tree collection.  Vote block formation is coordinated using the Matchmaking system.  Once the voting period is over, the vote collection is hashed.

See [Election Logic](election.md) for details on the election processes.

## Glossary of Terms

* **Administrator** - a person who, in combination with the other administrators, is authorized to act on behalf of an authority.
* **Authority** - district or entity involved in the voting process
  * **Election Authority** - the authority describing the overall event and timetable

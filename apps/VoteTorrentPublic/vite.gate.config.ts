// vite.gate.config.ts — the harness build config (D-19/D-20/D-17).
//
// Inherits `base` (this app's OWN vite.config.ts) via `mergeConfig` and adds
// ONLY `build.outDir`, `build.emptyOutDir` and `build.rollupOptions.input`.
// This file declares NO `resolve` key, NO `plugins` key and NO
// `server`/`preview` key of its own — every one of those is inherited, and
// that is the entire point: 53-11's D-20 negative control removes
// `resolve.dedupe` from `vite.config.ts` and requires the identity gate to
// fail. If this file carried its own `resolve` block, that mutation would
// never reach the gate build, the control would silently pass, and it would
// be a lookalike rather than a real negative control. NEVER add a `resolve`,
// `plugins` or `server`/`preview` key here — mirrors `vite.config.ts`'s own
// binding "this config must NEVER gain a resolve.alias" rule, restated for
// this file's own binding rule instead.
//
// Two out dirs, no ordering trap (the D-17-vs-D-19 conflict 53-CONTEXT.md
// flagged as a risk): `yarn build` still emits the honest, election-fact-free
// `dist/` that D-17's scan walks; `yarn build:gate` emits ONLY this harness
// into `dist-gate/`. `vite.config.ts` itself gains no `rollupOptions.input`
// of its own, so production stays single-entry.

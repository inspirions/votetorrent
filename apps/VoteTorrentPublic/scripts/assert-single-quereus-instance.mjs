/**
 * assert-single-quereus-instance.mjs — the artefact-level proof of the
 * precondition 54-03a placed on this phase and 54-11 discharged: exactly ONE
 * on-disk copy of `@quereus/quereus`, and exactly one of
 * `@quereus/plugin-indexeddb`, reaches the public app's built bundle.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS EVEN THOUGH THE BUILD IS GREEN. `.yarnrc.yml` sets
 * `nmHoistingLimits: workspaces`, so nothing is hoisted and
 * `packages/web-data` and this app each own a PHYSICAL COPY of the engine. A
 * second copy means a second `Database` CLASS IDENTITY and a second plugin
 * registry: plugin registration, or an `instanceof` boundary between the
 * handle the data package opens and the code that declares a schema onto it,
 * fails — and it fails IN A BUILD THAT STILL EXITS 0. That is the measured
 * spike-089 signature (a duplicate React was harmless for a zero-hook
 * component and dropped the same control from 18/18 to 8/12 once one
 * `useState` was involved, in a build that exited 0), one stack down. A green
 * build is therefore explicitly NOT accepted as evidence here, and neither is
 * a green `app-shape.test.mjs`: `resolve.dedupe` is a CONFIG INTENT, and this
 * script measures the ARTEFACT.
 *
 * WHY A SOURCEMAP AND NOT A BUNDLE GREP. esbuild renames bare local bindings,
 * so a `typeof` probe on a minified identifier is falsely inert (this repo has
 * measured that: a dist-level negative control must mutate a symbol in an
 * object-literal property-key position to survive minification at all). And a
 * string-literal probe cannot distinguish ONE copy from TWO — both bundles
 * contain the same literals. A sourcemap's `sources` array is the only place
 * in a built artefact where two physical copies are distinguishable: the
 * entries are real on-disk paths and are not minified.
 *
 * Follows `assert-no-node-polyfills.mjs`'s house shape: every control runs
 * BEFORE the build, and every control exercises the SAME analysis function the
 * real check uses, so a control that passes is really exercising the real
 * pipeline rather than a look-alike written beside it.
 *
 * Standalone Node script, no new dependencies.

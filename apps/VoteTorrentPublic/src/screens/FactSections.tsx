/**
 * FactSections.tsx — the body of the public election page: the facts, and,
 * just as prominently PLACED but far less prominently STYLED, the gaps
 * (D-11, D-12, D-14, D-16, D-35).
 *
 * Six things a later reader cannot infer from the code alone:
 *
 * 1. WHY THE GAP MODIFIER IS WRITTEN AS TWO LITERAL BRANCHES AND NEVER AS A
 *    TEMPLATE LITERAL. `scripts/lib/css-class-coverage.mjs`'s
 *    `extractStaticClassNameTokens` matches only brace-free
 *    `className="..."` attributes. A COMPUTED class attribute therefore makes
 *    the tier-1 class-coverage gate structurally BLIND to the gap modifier,
 *    and a mounted class with no matching selector is exactly the defect class
 *    this repo has already shipped twice past green gates — a code clipped at
 *    84 characters, and a whole screen rendered with no styling at all, both
 *    of which passed every gate because the gates asserted PRESENCE. The
 *    duplication between the two branches below IS the gate's evidence. Do not
 *    "clean it up" into a computed string.
 *
 * 2. WHY EVERY CARD CARRIES THE TWO `data-fact-*` ATTRIBUTES BELOW — a stable
 *    per-card identity, and the branch it took. (Named by prefix here rather
 *    than spelled out, so a raw grep for either attribute counts the two
 *    render sites and not this paragraph: a checker whose own prose satisfies
 *    the pattern it hunts is permanently green, and this phase has
 *    manufactured that failure seven times.) The browser
 *    tier must select one gap card and one filled card FROM THE SAME RENDERED
 *    PAGE and compare their computed styles; that comparison is the only thing
 *    that can prove the three de-emphasis cues actually reach a reader.
 *    Presence is not rendering, and no source scan in this repo can substitute
 *    for that assertion — a stable selector is what makes it writable at all.
 *    The `settling` phase renders both kinds together, which is why it is the
 *    phase that gate should use.
 *
 * 3. D-12: the plain human sentence is ON the card; the technical reason and
 *    its `doc/election.md` citation are behind the SHARED `DetailsToggle`.
 *    There is no second disclosure component anywhere in this file — building
 *    a parallel `<details>` element or a hand-rolled toggle would fork the
 *    D-19 React-identity gate's subject, whose whole value is that it is the
 *    one hook-calling component on the page.
 *
 * 4. D-12, the other half: the internal gap letters A-G are spike vocabulary
 *    and appear NOWHERE in this file. The `gap` / `filledGap` fields select a
 *    BRANCH; they are never interpolated, never rendered and never passed to
 *    `t()`. The repo has a standing rule against internal identifiers in
 *    user-facing strings, and a letter on a card would be one.
 *
 * 5. D-14: `keyrelease` takes the FILLED branch because its `gap` is `null`.
 *    There is no id-specific check anywhere below — the data decides, so a
 *    future entry that gains a `filledGap` renders correctly with no edit
 *    here. The key-release body is selected on `interpolates !== null` for the
 *    same reason. `facts.js` guarantees `keyrelease` is the only entry with a
 *    non-null `interpolates`; if that ever changed, `t()` would throw loudly
 *    on the missing parameter rather than rendering a wrong sentence, and that
 *    loud failure is the intended behaviour.
 *
 * 6. THE DENOMINATOR ON SCREEN IS `keyholderCount`, NOT `total`. `total`
 *    counts release-key work items, which is ZERO before any is raised — so a
 *    denominator taken from it would read "0 of 0" for the entire settling
 *    window, indistinguishable from a genuinely empty election
 *    (`54-RESEARCH.md` Pitfall 4, and `read-keyrelease.js`'s own JSDoc). The
 *    interpolation PARAMETER is still named `total`, because that is the
 *    placeholder 54-09's sentence declares and 54-04 froze in `interpolates`;
 *    renaming it would make `t()` throw. The name is the sentence's, the value
 *    is the keyholder count's.
 *
 * 7. THE ROLL BRANCH IS SELECTED ON THE DATA TOO, and the field it reads is
 *    `emptyKey`. That field means "this fact's body is a COLLECTION, which
 *    can legitimately be empty" -- exactly one entry in the model carries it,
 *    and the model is what makes that true rather than a hard-coded id here.
 *    A card whose body is a table also owns its own detail sentence and its
 *    own empty message, so BOTH the generic details toggle and the generic
 *    empty path are suppressed on this branch: the roll renders its
 *    disclaimer visibly above the table, and a second mount through the
 *    toggle would show the same sentence twice. Selecting on the id instead
 *    would put a render decision somewhere the model cannot see it, which is
 *    the same mistake point 5 rejects for the key-release branch.
 *
 * A FAULT IS NOT AN ABSENCE. When the key-release aggregate could not be
 * read, the card still renders and SAYS SO (D-23, applied to the one fact on
 * this page carrying live data). Dropping the card would make a read fault
 * indistinguishable from a deliberate withholding, which is the failure class
 * this whole phase exists to correct.
 *
 * No hook of any kind lives here: the only stateful behaviour on these cards
 * is `DetailsToggle`'s own. Every rendered string is a `t()` call — a literal
 * English run in JSX is a defect `scripts/lint-copy.mjs` fails on. No
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: authority-supplied text reaches the DOM only as a
 * JSX text node, where React's default escaping applies.

 *   reading  — 53-D18's inert, labelled skeleton slots, kept verbatim. D-02
 *              AMENDS 53-D18, it does not reverse it. NO status banner here:
 *              a banner saying "phase unknown" while the read is still in
 *              flight would make D-10's real state indistinguishable from a
 *              slow attach, which is the exact confusion D-02 removes.
 *   notHeld  — an explicit sentence saying this browser holds no usable copy
 *              of the election this link names, PLUS the same three labelled
 *              frames the election-less page shows (D-21): `.skeleton`'s
 *              established meaning was already "space left empty ON PURPOSE,
 *              nothing is loading" — "no record for this election" is a
 *              second cause of that same emptiness, not a repurposing of the
 *              class. Still NO banner: we did not fail to read a schedule,
 *              we hold no election, and claiming `bad` / "phase unknown"
 *              here would be a false sentence of the kind D-28 exists to
 *              catch. The banner distinction is unchanged; only the
 *              scaffolding parity is new.
 *   ready    — the real title and the real derived phase, led by the
 *              `.status-banner` headline and its tone chip. `unreadable`
 *              renders the same shape with a null election, so a fault
 *              surfaces as D-10's explicit unknown rather than as silence.
 *
 * WHAT 54-12 DELETED, and why the diff alone will not explain it. 54-05
 * installed a HOLDING MEASURE at the lifecycle skeleton's guard: it widened
 * that conditional from `phase === null` to also cover the indeterminate
 * phase, so the grey bar kept rendering across the four-phase vocabulary
 * change, and its own comment named this plan as the owner of the
 * replacement. That guard is now narrowed to the READ STATE and names no
 * phase at all. An unreadable schedule is answered in words by the banner
 * (tone `bad`, "this election's schedule can't be read, so its phase is
 * unknown") plus `LifecyclePill`'s own pill for that phase — D-10. The
 * divergence from `LifecyclePill`'s former render-nothing behaviour is
 * warranted by `ElectionRevision.Timeline` carrying zero CHECK constraints
 * (votetorrent.qsql:891, `-- TODO constrain Timeline`), so a broken schedule
 * is an EXPECTED input rather than an anomaly, and silence about an expected
 * input is indistinguishable from a deliberate withholding.
 *
 * The one distinction that is easy to lose when editing the branches below:
 * an address that names NO election is not a browser that fails to hold one.
 * That page keeps 54-11's index and all three of 53-D18's labelled slots
 * verbatim; only an ADDRESSED election can be `notHeld`.
 *
 * Exactly ONE `return` statement, deliberately — not style. `AdvisoryDisclosure`'s
 * own header states that the moment it can be conditioned on anything it can
 * be hidden, and `DetailsToggle`'s live hook is what makes the D-19 identity
 * gate and the D-20 dedupe control observable at all. A single return makes
 * both structurally unbranchable: neither can ever sit inside a conditional
 * branch this function takes. Every effect, every `await` and every cleanup
 * closure therefore lives in `use-public-election.ts`, whose own header
 * records the same constraint from the other side.

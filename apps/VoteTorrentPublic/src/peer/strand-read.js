/**
 * strand-read.js — the strand-connected, SELECT-only `Database` and the
 * `readRows` `56-09`'s `startPeerReplication` requires.
 *
 * NEVER OPENS, ROUTES OR WRITES TO THE UI's INDEXEDDB STORE HANDLE. Reading
 * is this module's whole job; `56-09`'s `reactivity-bridge.js` owns writing.
 * DOES NOT PROVE liveness (`56-11`), the D-16 inversion (`56-13`) or a
 * browser badge (`56-14`). Node tier only, against fakes of the seams.
 *
 * 1. WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `NotificationV1` carries collectionId, tailId,
 *    revision, digest and sig — and no rows (`@optimystic/db-core`
 *    `dist/src/reactivity/wire.d.ts:46-87`). A notification reports THAT a
 *    collection changed, never WHAT changed. `56-09`'s `startPeerReplication`
 *    therefore requires an injected `readRows` option and throws
 *    `PeerReplicationError` naming it when absent — `reactivity-bridge.js`'s
 *    own header calls this "the open seam this module does not close". This
 *    file is that injection, and nothing else: it reads, it never writes.
 *
 * 2. WHY THERE ARE TWO `Database` HANDLES, AND WHY THAT IS NOT THE TRAP.
 *    `@serfab/quereus-plugin-sereus` `dist/compose-strand.js:130` calls
 *    `db.setDefaultVtabName('optimystic')` (followed at `:131` by
 *    `setDefaultVtabArgs({ networkName, transactor, keyNetwork: 'libp2p' })`)
 *    on WHATEVER `Database` it is handed — every strand-connect entry in the
 *    ecosystem funnels through `composeStrand` (its own module comment names
 *    `connectToStrand`, `connectToStrandBrowser` and `StrandDatabase` as the
 *    three callers). `packages/web-data/src/open-db.js`'s UI store-handle
 *    opener calls the MANDATORY, opposite `db.setDefaultVtabName('store')` on
 *    the UI's handle — without it every table routes to the in-memory module
 *    and persistence becomes a silent no-op, same-session-invisible
 *    (`Skill("spike-findings-votetorrent")`). Handing the UI handle to a
 *    strand-connect entry would overwrite that routing by accident: exactly
 *    D-16's rejected store-module-swap alternative, arrived at sideways. So
 *    the strand read handle is a SEPARATE `Database`, owned by
 *    `StrandDatabase`, never produced by that UI store-handle opener, never
 *    carrying the IndexedDB store module's routing-name constant, never
 *    written to and never read by the UI. Exactly one IndexedDB store handle
 *    exists in the page; this module never produces, routes or writes to one
 *    — Task 3 group (a) is the standing control that proves the UI handle's
 *    `'store'` routing survives this module running. (This header
 *    deliberately never spells out either identifier by name — the grep this
 *    plan's acceptance criteria runs for them is unqualified, unlike the
 *    other prohibition checks below, so this paragraph stays out of its own
 *    way.)
 *
 * 3. WHY `StrandDatabase` AND NOT `@serfab/quereus-plugin-sereus/plugin-browser`.
 *    Measured this session, from installed bytes: the package's `exports` map
 *    has exactly three keys (`.`, `./plugin`, `./plugin-browser`) —
 *    `dist/connect-browser.js` and `dist/compose-strand.js` are NOT exported
 *    (`ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`), so `connectToStrandBrowser` is
 *    unreachable from here. The one browser entry that IS exported,
 *    `plugin-browser.js`, default-exports `register(db, config)` whose
 *    `config` is `Record<string, SqlValue>` (`dist/parse-config.d.ts`) — a
 *    shape that cannot carry `libp2pNode`, `coordinatedRepo` or `storage`
 *    (all object-valued on `StrandConnectionOptions`, `dist/types.d.ts`).
 *    Taking `/plugin-browser` anyway would build a SECOND libp2p node inside
 *    `connect-browser.js`'s own `createNode` seam (`webSockets() +
 *    circuitRelayTransport()`, a fresh `generateKeyPair('Ed25519')` on every
 *    construction per `@optimystic/db-p2p` `dist/src/libp2p-node-base.js:171`)
 *    and a SECOND IndexedDB store (`sereus-strand-<strandId>`) — two nodes
 *    per tab, one with a rotating peerId, which would refute `56-13`'s D-11
 *    control ("a reload within one tab reuses the same [peerId]") before it
 *    is even written, and would strand `56-05`'s injected session identity
 *    and per-strand block storage (D-18) on a node that runs no strand SQL.
 *    `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/test/node/strand-entry-reachability.test.mjs` is
 *    the standing instrument that pins these resolution facts, so a
 *    `@serfab/*` bump that changes them is noticed rather than silently
 *    absorbed.
 *
 * 4. WHY `transactor` IS NEVER NAMED IN THIS FILE. `StrandDatabase` passes no
 *    `transactor` option to `connectToStrand`, so `composeStrand` resolves the
 *    plugin's own default — `'network'`. `'local'` would read straight out of
 *    THIS PROCESS'S OWN raw storage, no peer consulted
 *    (`StrandTransactor`'s docstring, `dist/types.d.ts`), and would produce a
 *    page that looks correct while having replicated nothing —
 *    `project_stale_screen_mimics_lost_write` reincarnated as the very fix
 *    for it. `openStrandReadHandle` below asserts the RESOLVED value from
 *    `StrandDatabase.getTransactor()` and REJECTS if it is not `'network'` —
 *    a control, not a defensive check.
 *
 * 5. WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT PROVE. No liveness (`56-11`'s gate), no D-16
 *    inversion (`56-13`), no browser behaviour of any kind — this file is
 *    Node tier, exercised against fakes of the seams it reads. Nothing here
 *    is imported from `main.tsx`.
 *
 * `founder: false`, `strandType: 'o'` and `setSchemaPath(['App', 'main'])`
 * each carry their own citation at the call site below rather than being
 * re-explained here.
 *
 * SQL IDENTIFIER NOTE. Every `select * from <table>` built below interpolates
 * a TABLE NAME, never a value — and that name is drawn exclusively from
 * `PUBLIC_SUBSCRIBED_TABLES`, a frozen array this module imports and never
 * restates, so the identifier space is closed before this file's first line
 * runs. Rule R4 (`packages/web-data/src/public/read-election.js`'s header)
 * governs bound VALUES; there are none here to interpolate.

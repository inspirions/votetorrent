/**
 * edge-node.js — the browser Edge-tier libp2p node factory, plus the
 * per-strand IndexedDB block-storage seam that makes D-18 hold.
 *
 * This is the FIRST libp2p node this repository has ever constructed for a
 * browser. The two RN `CadreNodeProvider.tsx` files
 * (`apps/VoteTorrentAuthority`, `apps/VoteTorrentVoter`) are role analogs
 * only: their boot-effect lifecycle discipline (mount-guarded start,
 * stop-on-unmount, stop-if-unmounted-mid-boot, errors swallowed at
 * cleanup) and their event-driven-never-polled posture (D-10: no
 * `setInterval` anywhere) both transfer to this module. Their transport,
 * storage, identity, profile and schema-policy CHOICES do NOT — this app
 * reads an election as an anonymous Edge-tier observer, not a participant
 * device, and copying those choices wholesale produces a node that is
 * wrong in the six specific ways enumerated below. `edge-node-shape.test.mjs`
 * asserts each of the six absent, field by field, so a copy-paste
 * regression goes red rather than shipping quietly.
 *
 * THE D-18 ISOLATION ARGUMENT. `@optimystic/quereus-plugin-optimystic` maps
 * every table to the collection URI `tree://default/{TableName}` and caches
 * the local transactor under the fixed key `local:libp2p` — neither the
 * collection URI nor the transactor key carries a strandId. The database
 * INSTANCE is therefore the only isolation boundary this stack offers. One
 * shared `IndexedDBRawStorage` handle across two strands reproduces
 * `project_strand_storage_per_network_isolation` verbatim (the RN side
 * shipped exactly that bug once: every network's rows landed in the same
 * `tree://default/Authority` keyspace, contaminating `count(*)` across
 * networks). `openStrandBlockStorage` below opens one
 * `openOptimysticWebDb(name)` per strandId, with a name derivation that
 * fails closed on an invalid id rather than ever falling back to the
 * package default (`DEFAULT_DB_NAME`, `'optimystic'`) — that single
 * fallback line is the whole failure mode. Rejected alternatives, per
 * D-18: keying the store by `networkHash` (silently merges the day one
 * network carries multiple strands) and a single shared store (the bug
 * itself).
 *
 * BROWSER EXEMPTION FROM THE STRAND-STORAGE MIGRATION TODO. The open todo
 * `.planning/todos/pending/2026-06-25-strand-storage-migrate-old-networks.md`
 * covers the RN half's legacy shared-store data. The browser is exempt BY
 * CONSTRUCTION: these per-strand IndexedDB stores are created fresh, one
 * per strandId, from the moment this module exists — there is no legacy
 * browser store to migrate. (Recording that exemption in the todo itself is
 * `56-10`'s deliverable, not this module's; this header states it once so
 * a later reader does not have to re-derive it.)
 *
 * NAME-COLLISION GUARD. `strandStorageDbName` sanitises with cadre-core's
 * own `getStrandStoragePath` convention
 * (`strandId.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/g, '_')`), which is lossy: two distinct
 * raw ids that differ only in characters outside that alphabet sanitise to
 * the SAME string. A short non-cryptographic digest of the raw id (FNV-1a,
 * 32-bit) is appended so the two never collide. This digest is a naming
 * disambiguator only — it carries no security property and is not used
 * anywhere a collision would be a security concern.
 *
 * EXPLICIT NON-CARRIES from the RN provider. Do not reintroduce any of
 * these:
 *  1. `loadOrCreateRNPeerKey` / `loadOrCreateBrowserPeerKey` — identity
 *     comes from `identity.js`'s `loadOrCreateSessionPeerKey`, injected by
 *     the caller as `privateKey` (D-08, D-09).
 *  2. `profile: 'transaction'` — the RN PARTICIPANT profile. This is an
 *     Edge-tier reader; `fretProfile` set to `'edge'` is a different field
 *     with a different meaning.
 *  3. `storage: { provider: scopedStorageProvider }` — the RN callback
 *     shape belongs to `db-p2p-storage-rn`'s per-scope LevelDB. The web
 *     package takes a storage INSTANCE, one per strand (D-18).
 *  4. `requireSignedSchemas: false` — a documented VoteTorrent decision for
 *     the RN network-CREATION path. A read-only anonymous browser node
 *     creates no network; there is no policy here to relax.
 *  5. `strandFilter: { mode: 'all' }` — `StrandFilter` governs which
 *     strands a node PARTICIPATES in and is explicitly NOT D-03's
 *     observability allowlist. Left unset.
 *  6. `circuitRelayTransport(...)`, `network.relayAddrs`, `relay`,
 *     `listenAddrs`, `port`/`wsPort`, `hibernation`, `connectionGater`,
 *     `controlNetwork`, `PARTY_ID`, `CONTROL_ADDR`, and the
 *     `UPDATE_AFTER_DRONE_RESTART` sentinel. A browser dials out and does
 *     not listen. Bootstrap addresses arrive as a parameter from `56-06`'s
 *     config mechanism — this module does not fetch `config.json` itself.
 *
 * WHAT DOES CARRY: `createEdgeNode` returns a `stop()` that is idempotent,
 * safe after a partial or failed start, and swallows errors from both the
 * node stop and the database close — exactly like the RN cleanup.
 *
 * THE ONE TIMER THIS MODULE NOW CONSTRUCTS (56-17, re-opening the invariant
 * this header used to state as absolute — not deleting it, replacing it).
 * `cohortTopic.enabled: true` below causes `@optimystic/db-p2p`'s
 * `createCohortTopicHost` to install exactly ONE recurring `setInterval`
 * (`cohort-topic/host.js:538`), and that timer is OWNED by db-p2p's cohort-
 * topic host, never by this module: this module constructs the node that
 * carries it, and nothing here calls `setInterval`/`setTimeout` directly.
 * Each tick walks the host's own coord registry (`registry.all()`,
 * `cohort-topic/host.js:515`); with an empty registry — this browser's
 * steady state, because it publishes no listen address and (see the
 * `cohortTopic` option below) is willing to serve no tier, so nothing ever
 * dispatches a coord engine into existence on it — the tick performs ZERO
 * gossip frames, ZERO membership refreshes and ZERO demotion checks. It is
 * `unref()`'d on Node (`timer.unref?.()`, `cohort-topic/host.js:542`) and is
 * a plain numeric interval in a browser (there is no event loop to keep
 * alive there). This module still adds NO polling, NO reconnection backoff
 * and NO retry loop of its own — those remain absent, exactly as before.
 * The subscription RENEWAL cadence (`ttl/3`, the recurring OUTBOUND signal
 * this posture change actually introduces) belongs to
 * `reactivity-bridge.js`, named there, not here. Full reasoning and the
 * falsifiable predictions this posture makes: see
 * `56-17-COHORT-TOPIC-POSTURE.md`.
 *
 * Connection state is read from the node's own events by consumers
 * (`56-09`/`56-11`), which also own the `isMounted`-style cancellation
 * guard around this factory — `createEdgeNode` itself is a plain,
 * stateless-between-calls factory function.
 *
 * 7. Do not "simplify" `cohortTopic.host` away. A bare `cohortTopic: {
 *    enabled: true }` with no `host` object is NOT equivalent to what this
 *    module constructs: `createCohortTopicHost` resolves an omitted profile
 *    to `coreProfile()` (`cohort-topic/host.js:83`), and
 *    `libp2p-node-base.js:1186` reads that resolved profile back as the
 *    node's reactivity posture — an anonymous reader's browser would become
 *    a T3 reactivity FORWARDER for other readers (D-08/D-09/D-10). The
 *    `host.profile`/`host.minSigs` object below is the CORE of this
 *    module's posture, not incidental tuning; see
 *    `56-17-COHORT-TOPIC-POSTURE.md`.
 *
 * 8. THIS MODULE ATTACHES A DIAGNOSTIC-ONLY CONNECTION-LIFECYCLE TAP (56-24).
 *    The instant `resolvedDeps.createLibp2pNode(...)` resolves,
 *    `attachConnectionLifecycleTap` (`./connection-lifecycle-probe.js`) is
 *    called on the constructed node. It attaches listeners and mutates
 *    nothing on the node itself — state lives in the probe module's own
 *    `WeakMap`, never on a node property. It adds NO timer and NO polling of
 *    its own (the standing D-10 posture above is preserved, not re-opened):
 *    it only reacts to libp2p's own connection/peer events as they fire.
 *    Its observation window begins only once `createLibp2pNode` has
 *    RESOLVED, which is AFTER that factory's own internal `node.start()` —
 *    any event during `node.start()` itself is outside what this tap can
 *    see, and `56-24-CONNECTION-MEASUREMENT.md` names that residual rather
 *    than rounding past it. The tap's attach is wrapped so a probe failure
 *    can never fail node construction; this module builds no fix from
 *    whatever the tap observes.

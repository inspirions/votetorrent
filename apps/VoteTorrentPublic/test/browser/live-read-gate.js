/**
 * live-read-gate.js — D-27's browser gate: a page already mounted against a
 * browser-local database is proven to RE-RENDER when a write lands in that
 * database through a SECOND handle, in ONE page load, with no reload and no
 * navigation.
 *
 * `54-PATTERNS.md` § No Analog Found lists this harness as one of only two
 * files in the phase with no analog anywhere in the repo. Its rung/settle
 * readout convention is borrowed from
 * `apps/VoteTorrentDashboard/test/browser/db-gate.js`; the two-handle idea is
 * this file's own.
 *
 * THREE THINGS TO READ BEFORE QUOTING A GREEN RUN
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. IT PROVES THE SEAM, NOT THE SYNC. A green run says the page re-renders
 *    when a SAME-ORIGIN write lands. It says nothing about replication: there
 *    is no `libp2p`, no `@serfab` and no `db-p2p` anywhere in the web tree
 *    (verified), the browser store is filled by a one-time bootstrap
 *    redemption, and real replication is gated on P2P-11 and belongs to a
 *    later phase. What a green run DOES buy is that when sync arrives, the
 *    page is already correct with no UI rework — which is D-27's whole claim.
 *
 * 2. BOTH HANDLES ARE IN ONE ORIGIN BECAUSE INDEXEDDB IS ORIGIN-PARTITIONED.
 *    That is not a shortcut, it is the only shape that exists today.
 *    `54-ISSUES.md` I-01 leaves the production topology — whether the two web
 *    apps share one origin — an open question, and 54-17 carries it to the
 *    user. This gate seeds same-origin by construction and settles nothing
 *    about that question.
 *
 * 3. THE WRITE IS READ BACK THROUGH AN AGGREGATE, ON PURPOSE. A remote notice
 *    cannot invalidate the receiving handle's point-lookup read cache — the
 *    store provider is unreachable through any public API, so there is nothing
 *    to invalidate it with (see `subscribe.js`'s header, point 5). The bound
 *    is that the cached store always delegates iteration and approximate-count
 *    to the underlying store, so scans and aggregates are unaffected. The fact
 *    this gate watches is a `count(*)`, which is inside that bound. A gate
 *    that watched a primary-key point lookup would be measuring the caveat
 *    rather than the seam.
 *
 * NO `setTimeout` ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE. Two reasons, both recorded rather
 * than stylistic. After `deleteNetworkDb`, a successful `deleteDatabase` can be
 * resurrected as an empty shell by an un-awaited write from the shared
 * connection singleton, and the recorded fix yields through a `MessageChannel`
 * round trip, never a timer — `fake-indexeddb` is blind to the whole class, so
 * only a real browser can see it. And every wait for a render is a bounded
 * poll driven by `requestAnimationFrame` raced against a `MessageChannel` tick,
 * so a frame budget expiring is a NAMED red rung rather than a sleep that was
 * too short on a slow machine.
 *
 * The page renders NO VERDICT. It publishes `window.__LIVE_READ_GATE__` and
 * sets `window.__LIVE_READ_GATE_DONE__`; grading is `run-live-read-gate.mjs`'s
 * job, exactly as `db-gate.js` leaves grading to `run-headless.mjs`. A harness
 * that graded itself would be a rung nobody else could invert.
 *
 * `?control=nolisten` is the INVERSION: it skips the writer's
 * `enableChangePropagation` call and nothing else. Under it, rungs 8 and 9 must
 * FAIL — that is what `--prove-frozen` requires, and without it "the page
 * updated" passes vacuously.
 *
 * Every step element is written with `textContent` and by no other means:
 * nothing derived from the database may reach the DOM as markup. The
 * markup-writing property's NAME is deliberately not spelled anywhere in this
 * file — the shape check that forbids it scans this file's RAW bytes, comments
 * included, so a comment merely mentioning it would make that check
 * permanently red. Its mirror image (a checker whose own prose SATISFIES the
 * pattern it hunts, and is therefore permanently green) has been manufactured
 * nine times in this phase; this is the tenth, caught here.

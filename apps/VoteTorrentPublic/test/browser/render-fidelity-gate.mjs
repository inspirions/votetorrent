/**
 * render-fidelity-gate.mjs — the browser-tier proof that the public election
 * page RENDERS what 54-06's reads return, against a database seeded with real
 * rows (54-16 Task 3; D-11, D-14, D-18, D-19).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, which is the thing a later reader will get
 * wrong first. Every rung below could be written as a source scan, and every
 * one of those scans would be worthless. This repository has shipped an
 * 84-character code that clipped silently and an entire screen with no styling
 * applied, both past green gates, because those gates asserted PRESENCE —
 * a class attribute is in the markup, a component is in the tree — rather than
 * RENDERING. Presence is not rendering. A computed `border-top-style`, a
 * measured `scrollWidth`, and the exact string sitting in a `td` are the only
 * evidence that a reader would actually experience what the CSS declares, and
 * none of the three can be obtained without a browser holding a real layout.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, and against what. The harness's
 * `?fixture=public-surface` branch seeds a real browser-side database and
 * mounts the shell with NO injected election, so the page under measurement is
 * produced by the genuine read path. The harness then publishes the FIXTURE's
 * own exported values on `__UI_GATE__.fixture`. Every data-derived expectation
 * below is read from that channel — this file hard-codes no registrant name,
 * no district, no marker and no release count. The three column headings are
 * the one exception and they are not fixture data: the UI spec records them as
 * the single place a raw schema identifier renders verbatim, so they are the
 * spec's literals, asserted here as literals.
 *
 * THE DIVISION OF LABOUR WITH 54-18, recorded so that plan does not duplicate
 * this one. `--prove-matchers` proves every COMPARATOR in this file can
 * report failure, by running each against a synthetic input built to violate
 * it. It deliberately does NOT rebuild a mutated product: 53-D20's rule is
 * that a build-level negative control REBUILDS rather than injecting at
 * runtime, and that a dist-level control must mutate a symbol in an
 * object-literal property-key position because the minifier renames bare
 * local bindings. Those controls belong to `mutations.mjs`, which is 54-18's
 * file. This file proves the comparators can fail; 54-18 proves the built
 * product can fail them. 54-18 also owns rehoming these rungs into the shared
 * runner, `run-ui-gates.mjs` — until then this script is standalone and
 * self-running so it is verifiable now.
 *
 * WHAT IS COPIED FROM `run-ui-gates.mjs` RATHER THAN INVENTED: the Playwright
 * import (the full package, never the core-only sibling, never a named browser
 * channel, never a hardcoded system-Chrome path — that path does not exist on
 * the CI image), `chromium.launch({ headless: true })`, the static server
 * (`lib/serve-dist.mjs`, not a second one), the dist walk that resolves the
 * built entry by SEARCH rather than by predicting the bundler's output path
 * algebra, the frozen rung-id registry, and `record(id, passed, detail)`.
 * A rung id may never interpolate a value under test into its own name: a
 * check named after something computed is a check nobody else can invert.
 *
 * PORT POLICY. `5193`, distinct from every port the phase already binds
 * (`5180`/`5181` dev and preview, `5183` the dashboard gate, `5191` the public
 * app's own gate run). Distinct from `5191` specifically so this gate and
 * `test:browser` can run concurrently. A bound port fails the run loudly —
 * `serve-dist.mjs` propagates the listen error rather than picking another.
 *
 * FLAGS:
 *   --skip-build       Reuse an existing `dist-gate/` rather than rebuilding.
 *   --prove-matchers   Run every comparator against a violating input AND
 *                      against a healthy one, and require the first to FAIL
 *                      and the second to PASS. Needs no browser and no build.
 *   --port <n>         Override the bound port.
 * Any other argument exits 2 naming it — an unknown flag must never be
 * silently ignored into a green run.

/**
 * `--prove-gap-cues-flattened` — the BUILD-LEVEL half of this gate's negative
 * control, and the half `--prove-matchers` structurally cannot supply.
 *
 * `--prove-matchers` runs every comparator against synthetic inputs, so it
 * proves the comparators fire. It cannot see a SHIPPED STYLESHEET that
 * stopped carrying the gap cues, because it never builds or loads one. This
 * mode closes exactly that gap: it rebuilds a real mutant artefact with the
 * gap-card rule's declaration body flattened and re-runs the SAME rungs
 * against it, requiring `gap-card-style-diverges` — and only it — to fail.
 *
 * Four verdicts are kept distinct on purpose, because collapsing any two of
 * them is how a control becomes decorative:
 *   - CONTROL COULD NOT RUN: the healthy leg did not fully pass, or the
 *     mutant build failed. Nothing can be attributed to the mutation.
 *   - MUTATION IS A NO-OP: the mutant build exited 0 but the plugin flattened
 *     nothing. Distinct from an inert gate: the gate was never tested.
 *   - WRONG FAILURE SHAPE: the mutant page crashed, went vacuous, or took
 *     down rungs other than the target. A blank page failing everything is
 *     not evidence the style rung works.
 *   - IS INERT: the mutant leg still PASSED the target rung. This prints the
 *     literal sentinel `web-gates.yml` greps across every control in this
 *     repo, so it is readable by the mechanism already in place.

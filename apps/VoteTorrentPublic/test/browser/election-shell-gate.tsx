/**
 * election-shell-gate.tsx — the built harness entry 53-09's gates run
 * against (53-07 builds this page; 53-09 owns the runner invocation, the
 * identity and token rungs, and `test:browser`'s wiring — see this app's
 * package.json and 53-07-PLAN.md's Interface Contract for the split).
 *
 * WHAT A GREEN RUN HERE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF — read this before quoting it:
 * this page mounts `ElectionShell` with a FIXTURE election it was handed
 * directly as a prop. It says nothing about a real data path (there is
 * none in this phase), and it carries no pass/fail verdict of its own —
 * grading what it renders is 53-09's runner's job, not this page's. A
 * harness that graded itself would be a rung nobody else could invert.
 *
 * `?phase=pre|voting|settling|closed` selects which of
 * `FIXTURE_INSTANTS`' four canonical instants this page renders against,
 * defaulting to `voting`. This is THIS PAGE's own URL parameter, read by
 * this file only — it is never forwarded into `ElectionShell`'s own
 * address, which is why `search` is passed explicitly below rather than
 * left to default to `window.location.search` (T-53-07-04's harness-side
 * proof: the shell's address input is genuinely injectable, not just
 * theoretically so).
 *
 * Deliberately calls no engine preflight step and assigns no production
 * readout global of any kind — that global belongs to `main.tsx` (53-06),
 * and forging it here would make the D-17 token list ambiguous about what
 * counts as a harness artefact.
 *
 * 53-09 EXTENSION — the shared runner's second invocation. Adds:
 * (a) imperative `data-ui-gate="<ExportName>"` tagging of the elements
 *     `ElectionShell` already genuinely rendered (`AdvisoryDisclosure`,
 *     `LifecyclePill`, `DetailsToggle`) — `AdvisoryDisclosure`/`LifecyclePill`
 *     render only a text node with no child element, so each is WRAPPED in a
 *     harness-only container element (never restructuring `ElectionShell`'s
 *     own tree, which this file never imports for editing) so the runner's
 *     `shared-components-mounted` rung's `childElementCount > 0` check has a
 *     genuine child to see; `DetailsToggle`'s own `.dt-toggle-group` wrapper
 *     already contains its button as a child element and is tagged directly.
 * (b) a SEPARATE `[data-ui-gate="hook-root"]` region, mounted in its OWN
 *     React root (a container `appendChild`-ed to `document.body`, never
 *     nested under `#root`) so a hook-dispatcher render throw there cannot
 *     unmount or blank the `ElectionShell` region — the structural half of
 *     the measured 19/19 → 8/12 PARTIAL failure signature (the runner-side
 *     half is `run-ui-gates.mjs`'s per-rung `try`/`catch`). Mounts
 *     `DetailsToggle` a SECOND time, independent of the instance
 *     `ElectionShell` renders internally, exactly mirroring
 *     `apps/VoteTorrentDashboard/test/browser/ui-gate.tsx`'s own hook-root.
 * (c) `window.__UI_GATE__` — the ONE channel the shared runner reads
 *     (`mounted`, `error`, `identity`), nesting 53-07's own
 *     `window.__ELECTION_SHELL_GATE__` readout unchanged under `.election`.
 *     There is one readout the runner reads; the other is 53-07's own DOM
 *     read-back record, which grades nothing — both stay assigned, neither
 *     replaces the other.
 *
 * 54-16 EXTENSION — the `?fixture=public-surface` branch. ADDITIVE: with the
 * parameter ABSENT every behaviour above is byte-identical — the default path
 * still mounts with the prop-supplied fixture election, the hook root still
 * mounts in its own React root, `__UI_GATE__` still publishes the same fields,
 * and no existing rung sees a different page. With the parameter PRESENT this
 * page instead seeds a REAL browser-side database (delete → create → seed →
 * record the row counts → record the network) and mounts the shell with NO
 * `election` prop at all, so `shouldReadFor` returns true and the shell takes
 * its genuine read path. That is the whole point: every rung in
 * `render-fidelity-gate.mjs` measures rendered output produced from rows, not
 * from a prop.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS BRANCH MUST DO THAT ARE EASY TO MISS. The shell's read path
 * is `findNetwork` → `attachNetworkDb`, and `attachNetworkDb` reads a
 * persisted row-count record before it will hand back a handle. A branch that
 * recorded only the network would attach-fail with the missing-counts error,
 * the shell would render its addressed-but-not-held sentence, and every rung
 * below would report a defect that is really a missing precondition. And the
 * seeding handle is CLOSED before the shell mounts: the shell opens its own,
 * and this page must not hold a second connection against it.
 *
 * THIS PAGE STILL CARRIES NO VERDICT OF ITS OWN. `__UI_GATE__.fixture` is a
 * publication of the FIXTURE's own exported values — never a measurement of
 * the page — so the gate script compares the DOM against the fixture rather
 * than against numbers it restated. Grading remains the runner's job.

/**
 * mesh-read-gate.js — the phase's proof bar (D-19) and D-16's liveness proof,
 * in a REAL browser: mesh read with the officer-populated path absent, then
 * liveness in one page load.
 *
 * `56-11-PLAN.md`'s own framing, restated here so a reader does not have to
 * cross-reference: this page answers three questions no existing instrument
 * answers — (a) does a browser read an election THROUGH THE MESH, with the
 * officer-populated path absent; (b) does a change ORIGINATED IN ANOTHER
 * PROCESS arrive and re-render WITHOUT A RELOAD; (c) does it run against the
 * REAL `56-08` gateway, with `56-04`'s patch applied and provenance-checked.
 *
 * NO FIXTURE IMPORT ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE — a strictly stronger property
 * than `live-read-gate.js` has. Everything this page needs to know about the
 * seeded election (`electionId`, `networkHash`, `title`, `atInstant`, the two
 * keyholder counts) arrives as DATA, fetched from `/gate-expectations.json`,
 * which `run-mesh-read-gate.mjs` writes into the served root at gate runtime
 * from the origin's own stdout facts. This is what makes D-19(a)'s "the
 * officer-populated path is absent" PROVABLE rather than asserted: the only
 * path the rows in rungs 5/6 can have taken is the strand mesh.
 *
 * `network`/`election` are read from THIS PAGE'S OWN `location.search` — set
 * by the driver's one `page.goto` — never constructed internally the way
 * `live-read-gate.js` builds its own `search` string from compile-time
 * constants. This gate's network hash is chosen FRESH per run by the driver
 * (a per-run strandId), so it cannot be a compile-time constant here.
 *
 * NO `setTimeout` ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE, for the recorded reason
 * `live-read-gate.js`'s header names: after a store delete, a successful
 * `deleteDatabase` can be resurrected as an empty shell by an un-awaited
 * write from the shared connection singleton, and the recorded fix yields
 * through a `MessageChannel` round trip, never a timer —
 * `fake-indexeddb` is blind to the whole class, so only a real browser can
 * see it.
 *
 * The page renders NO VERDICT. It publishes `window.__MESH_READ_GATE__` and
 * sets `window.__MESH_READ_GATE_DONE__`; grading is `run-mesh-read-gate.mjs`'s
 * job. This plan claims no inversion — that is `56-13`'s.
 *
 * Every step element is written with `textContent` and by no other means:
 * nothing derived from the database may reach the DOM as markup. The
 * markup-writing property's NAME is deliberately not spelled anywhere in
 * this file — see `live-read-gate.js`'s header for the self-tripping-checker
 * reason this discipline exists.

 * 6,400 times a SECOND. Rung 5's predicate is a full Quereus `select` over
 * IndexedDB, so a rung that is genuinely failing — as rung 5 does the moment
 * rung 4's peer boot fails — drove ~300,000 IndexedDB-backed SQL reads through
 * the renderer in 47 seconds and killed the renderer process outright
 * ("Target crashed"), before its own 60,000ms budget expired. Measured on
 * 2026-09-05: `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize` stayed FLAT at 51.0MB
 * throughout, so this was never a JS-heap leak — it is renderer-side

 * crashed", `page.on('pageerror')` never fired, and the gate's real red rungs
 * — including rung 4's actual named error — were never published at all. A
 * gate that dies instead of reporting a named red rung measures nothing.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A LOOSENED RUNG. Every rung keeps its exact predicate and its
 * exact wall-clock budget; only the RATE at which the predicate is re-asked
 * changes, from ~6,400/s to at most ~62/s. A rung that would have passed still

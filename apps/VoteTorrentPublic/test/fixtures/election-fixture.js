/**
 * A frozen `{ title, timeline, date, ballotDeadline }` fact set (Phase 54,

 * `ELECTION_EVENT_ORDER` keys, adopted verbatim from
 * `apps/VoteTorrentDashboard/test/fixtures/seed-election-surface.js`'s
 * `SEED_TIMELINE` (the repo's only other real seven-event timeline) so the
 * public fixture and the dashboard's only real seven-event fixture agree.
 * Every value is a canonical 19-character datetime with NO trailing `Z` —
 * `toCanonicalDatetime` silently strips a trailing `Z`, so keeping one here
 * would test nothing it appears to test (see `election-phase.js`'s own
 * header FINDING).
 *
 * `ballotsFinal` (October 1) deliberately PRECEDES `registrationEnds`
 * (October 5). This is NOT a mistake and must not be "fixed": spike 086
 * narrowed its ordering rule specifically because finalising ballot content
 * and closing voter registration are independent preparation tracks, and
 * this ordering is what exercises the narrowed rule rather than the naive
 * declaration-order-is-chronological one (see `election-phase.js`'s
 * `parseTimeline` ORDERING comment).
 *
 * `date` and `ballotDeadline` are the two schema-enforced values
 * `parseTimeline` cross-checks the unenforced JSON blob against — without
 * them three of the six `CONFLICT` codes are unreachable and the empty-
 * conflicts assertion below is weaker than it looks. Verified by hand that
 * this fixture satisfies all three reachable cross-checks:
 *   - `ballotsFinal` (2026-10-01) precedes `ballotDeadline` (2026-11-01).
 *   - `registrationEnds`, `ballotsFinal` and `votingStarts` all fall before
 *     the END of election day (`date` + 24h = 2026-11-04T00:00:00) —
 *     `votingStarts` at 08:00 on election day itself is fine.
 *   - `closed` (2026-11-20) follows `date` (2026-11-03).

/**
 * registrant-roll-fixture.js — TEST-ONLY. Nothing under
 * `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/src` may import this file (D-17): a production
 * bundle containing these facts would let a public page assert election facts
 * that are not true, on a page whose entire purpose is that its claims can be
 * checked. `test/node/election-harness.test.mjs` asserts the absence of any
 * import specifier reaching `fixtures/` (or `test/`) from `src/`.
 *
 * Frozen exports, and no import from anything this app builds — the one import
 * below is the signing primitive, nothing else. Every rendered string carries
 * the literal `vtx-fixture` marker so a `dist/` scan has a token to name.
 *
 * ONE EXTRA HEADER RULE, SPECIFIC TO THIS FILE. These rows are SYNTHETIC
 * PERSONAL DATA that is rendered verbatim on an ANONYMOUS page. Nothing
 * transforms them in between. So:
 *   - every `District` value must contain the literal `vtx-fixture`; and
 *   - no name may be a plausible real person's.
 * A reader who somehow reached this data in production must be able to tell at
 * a glance that it is scaffolding. `public-fixtures.test.mjs` asserts the
 * district marker on every row the roll read returns, so a row that lost it
 * fails tier 1 rather than shipping quietly.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Until it landed, no fixture in this repo seeded
 * `RegistrantPublic`, so `readRegistrantRoll` had only ever been observed
 * returning `[]` — its `RP.Cid = R.PublicCid` fan-out pin and its
 * `R.Status = 'a'` filter were asserted by SOURCE SCAN only, and a scan proves
 * the column list, not that the join returns the rows the list describes.
 *
 * PRODUCTION-LENGTH BY MANDATE, NOT BY TASTE (D-19). Every `lastName` and
 * `firstName` here is at least 12 characters and every `district` at least 20,
 * per 54-UI-SPEC § Fixture & Sample-Instant Requirements item 2. This project
 * has TWICE shipped a UI defect every gate passed because the fixture was too
 * short to fail: an 84-character code that clipped silently, and a 7-character
 * name that satisfied a check a production-length one would not. Shortening any
 * value here re-opens that blindness.

 * REISSUED — behind a real `vrg` signing ceremony and a real secp256k1
 * signature.
 *
 * `ceremony` IS A PARAMETER, NOT AN IMPORT. The helper lives in
 * `packages/web-data/test/fixtures/seed-election-surface.js`; injecting it
 * keeps this module reachable from both the tier-1 suite and a browser bundle
 * without this file reaching across the package boundary itself.
 *
 * `Registrant.SignatureValid` calls the crypto plugin FOR REAL — unlike
 * `AdminSigning`, this table has NO `context.IsSignatureValid` escape hatch —
 * so these rows carry an actual secp256k1 signature. ONE keypair is generated
 * for the whole fixture; the authority signs every row.
 *
 * TWO ORDERING RULES, AND THEY ARE THE WHOLE REASON THIS WORKS:
 *
 *  (a) THE REISSUE IS NOT WRAPPED IN A TRANSACTION.
 *      `RegistrantPublic.RegistrantCidMatch` contains a subquery and is
 *      therefore deferred to COMMIT. Each `db.exec` autocommits, so the
 *      superseded row is validated at ITS OWN commit, while
 *      `Registrant.PublicCid` still equals the old content id. Batching the
 *      reissue into one transaction would evaluate that row's deferred check
 *      AFTER the update moved `PublicCid` forward, and the superseded row would
 *      be rejected — the fan-out this fixture exists to create would silently
 *      never form.
 *      (`keyrelease-fixture.js` needs the EXACT OPPOSITE for its Task/extension
 *      pair. Both are stated side by side in that file's header so the contrast
 *      reads as deliberate rather than as an inconsistency to "fix".)
 *
 *  (b) The superseded row SURVIVES the update because constraints are evaluated
 *      against the MUTATING table's rows: updating `Registrant` does not
 *      re-evaluate `RegistrantPublic`'s checks. `InsertOnly` then makes the
 *      superseded row permanent.

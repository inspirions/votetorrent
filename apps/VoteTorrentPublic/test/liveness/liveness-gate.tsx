/**
 * liveness-gate.tsx — the harness for 56-14's computed-style browser gate
 * (Surface 5: D-16's UI feedback half, D-19's UI half).
 *
 * Modelled on `test/offline/offline-gate.tsx`'s own shape: imports
 * `../../src/app.css` FIRST so the built bundle carries `app.css`,
 * `tokens.css` and `components.css`; the module-constant `source` awaits the
 * real `attachNetworkDb` and records the resolved handle; a bounded
 * `requestAnimationFrame` poll settles readiness — never a fixed sleep. See
 * that file's own header for the conventions this one inherits rather than
 * re-derives.
 *
 * MOUNTS `ElectionShell` DIRECTLY, NEVER `PublicApp`. `PublicApp.tsx` (56-14,
 * Task 1) owns the ONE production `startPublicPeerBoot` call site, and this
 * gate's whole subject is the seam from `applyPeerRowBatch` +
 * `notifyPeerWrite` onward — the real store write, the real projection, the
 * real hook, the real render, the real CSS. The libp2p transport and the
 * threshold-signature verification IN FRONT OF that seam are `56-11`'s proof
 * (`test:mesh-read`) and are not re-claimed here; mounting `PublicApp` would
 * additionally attempt a real peer dial this gate's `publicDir: false` build
 * has no `config.json` to satisfy, and would conflate two different proofs.
 *
 * `peerFeed` ARRIVES FROM THIS PAGE'S OWN `?feed=` PARAMETER, constrained to
 * the three-valued union `usePublicElection` accepts. Anything else is a
 * HARNESS ERROR recorded on the readout, never a silent default — a silently
 * defaulted `'unobserved'` would make rung 5's `feed=stopped` navigation
 * indistinguishable from a typo.
 *
 * WHY `applyLocalWrite` CANNOT USE `Election` AS ITS OWN FIRING VEHICLE, and
 * how it is built instead — measured this session, stated here rather than
 * discovered by a future reader chasing a rung that stays green for the
 * wrong reason:
 *
 *   1. `Election`'s own schema carries `constraint InsertOnly check on
 *      update, delete (false)` (`votetorrent.qsql`) — an UNCONDITIONAL
 *      CHECK. An ordinary SQL `update ... set Title = ...` against `Election`
 *      is refused by the engine itself, with or without a valid signing
 *      context; there is no legitimate SQL path that changes an existing
 *      election's title.
 *   2. `Database.ingestExternalRowChanges` (the seam `applyPeerRowBatch`
 *      wraps) NEVER fires a module `db.onDataChange` event, under EITHER
 *      `captureChanges` setting — measured directly this session, not
 *      inferred from the docstring: `captureChanges` feeds `Database.watch`'s
 *      post-commit dispatch, a DIFFERENT subscription system from the
 *      per-module `onDataChange` `subscribe.js` listens on. So the external
 *      seam can silently change what a handle reads without ever notifying
 *      that handle's own subscription — which is exactly why `notifyPeerWrite`
 *      exists as a SEPARATE, manually-invoked channel (`REMOTE_SINKS`), and
 *      exactly why that channel has no `remote: false` mode: nothing about
 *      it is tied to a genuine local engine event at all.
 *   3. So `applyLocalWrite` does TWO things, deliberately, and the second is
 *      the one that makes the discrimination real: (a) apply the SAME
 *      Title-changing external write `applyPeerBatch` uses, SILENTLY (no
 *      `notifyPeerWrite` call) — the store now holds the new title, and
 *      nothing has been told; then (b) perform a GENUINE, ordinary SQL
 *      `delete` against a seeded `Keyholder` row -- the exact row
 *      `test/browser/live-read-gate.js`'s own rung 7 already proved needs no
 *      signing ceremony to touch -- through THIS SAME handle. That delete is
 *      real engine DML: it fires a REAL local `db.onDataChange` event,
 *      delivered with `remote` unset (`event?.remote === true` is false), so
 *      `subscribeToPublicChanges` marks the resulting notice `remote: false`.
 *      That notice is what actually reaches `bumpDataVersion` and forces the
 *      full re-read that reveals the ALREADY-CHANGED title. The rendered
 *      title change is therefore genuine and the triggering notice is
 *      genuinely local — exactly what rung 4 needs to discriminate, and the
 *      only way this schema admits it.
 *
 * WHY THIS GATE SEEDS A SECOND ELECTION UNDER ITS OWN PRODUCTION-LENGTH ID,
 * RATHER THAN REUSING `FIXTURE_ELECTION_DB_ID`. `seed-public-surface.js`'s
 * own header records that `FIXTURE_ELECTION_DB_ID` (`SEED_ELECTION.id`,
 * `'e1'`) is a deliberately SHORT, 2-character seed token — exactly the
 * `project_ui_defects_invisible_to_every_tier` shape the runner's own
 * anti-vacuity check refuses (a requested election id under 43 characters,
 * or failing `ELECTION_ID_PATTERN`, is a hard bail, never a pass). `e1`
 * would make every navigation this gate makes vacuous by construction. This
 * file therefore clones `e1`'s own `Election`/`ElectionRevision` rows
 * BYTE-IDENTICAL except for the id (via the SAME external-write seam
 * `applyPeerBatch` uses), under `LIVENESS_ELECTION_ID` (43 characters,
 * `ELECTION_ID_PATTERN`-conformant, distinct from `UNHELD_ELECTION_ID`), and
 * bumps `writeRowCounts` by exactly the two rows added — `attachNetworkDb`
 * compares live counts to the recorded ones EXACTLY (`reattach.js`'s
 * `assertRowCounts`) and would refuse every subsequent attach with
 * `RowCountMismatchError` otherwise. The original `e1` election is left
 * completely untouched; nothing this gate does affects
 * `PUBLIC_SURFACE_EXPECTED_COUNTS`'s own meaning for any OTHER gate, and no
 * other gate shares this gate's own origin (port 5196) or its IndexedDB
 * namespace.

/**
 * external-write-seam-sites.test.mjs — `56-09` Task 3's standing instrument:
 * the external-write seam (`applyExternalRowChanges`, and the `Database`
 * method that ingests its output -- see `SEAM_TOKEN` below for the exact
 * name; it is deliberately not spelled out in this paragraph, see the
 * anti-self-trip note further down -- "built for trusted replication-style
 * writes", running NO constraint validation) may appear in exactly the two
 * recorded production sites in this repo, pinned by a repo-wide scan rather
 * than the one-off plan-time grep `snapshot-restore.js`'s header used to cite.
 *
 * REPLACES a stale claim. `apps/VoteTorrentDashboard/src/lifecycle/
 * snapshot-restore.js`'s header used to say the seam "may appear in EXACTLY
 * ONE FILE, this one" -- true when written, false the moment `56-09` added
 * the second site. This file is the standing check that claim is now pinned
 * to, and `56-09` Task 3 also corrects that header's prose (comment-only
 * edit) to say so.
 *
 * ANTI-SELF-TRIP DISCIPLINE (`project_self_tripping_checker_headers`, three
 * recurrences in Phase 53):
 *
 *   1. This instrument lives under `test/`, and every scan root below is a
 *      `src/` tree only -- structurally, this file can never scan itself.
 *   2. Comments are stripped (via the shared `stripComments` this repo's
 *      other scans already use) before matching, so a `src/` file that
 *      merely DISCUSSES the seam in a header comment -- as both
 *      `reactivity-bridge.js` and `snapshot-restore.js` now do, at length --
 *      is not counted. `subscribe.js` names the seam once, in prose inside a
 *      JSDoc block; that mention must be stripped, not counted, and the
 *      self-check group below proves the stripper does exactly that.
 *   3. The assertion below is SET EQUALITY against a frozen two-element
 *      expectation -- never a `=== 0` or a `>= 1` count. Equality carries its
 *      own positive control: if the scan silently stopped reading files, the
 *      expected set would not be found and this test would fail loudly
 *      rather than passing on a narrowed, unverified root.
 *
 * The token this instrument searches for is assembled from concatenated
 * fragments at runtime (below), so this file's own source never spells it
 * out as a contiguous literal -- belt-and-braces on top of point 1, since a
 * root-widening mistake that ever pointed a scan at `test/` would otherwise
 * make this checker permanently green on itself.

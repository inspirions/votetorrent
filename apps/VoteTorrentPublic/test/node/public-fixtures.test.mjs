/**
 * public-fixtures.test.mjs — tier-1 proof that the public surface's fixtures
 * satisfy the schema, and that 54-06's public reads return the rows those
 * fixtures describe.
 *
 * HONESTY NOTE. This proves two things and no more: (1) the seed satisfies
 * every schema constraint on the path it walks, and (2) `readRegistrantRoll`
 * and `readKeyReleaseProgress` return the expected rows WITHIN ONE PROCESS
 * against `fake-indexeddb`. It says NOTHING about rendering — not that the roll
 * appears, not that it scrolls rather than clips, not that `ExtraFields` stays
 * off the page. Those are the browser-tier gate's obligation
 * (`test/browser/render-fidelity-gate.mjs`), and no assertion or test name here
 * may suggest otherwise.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS. Before this file, no fixture in this repo seeded
 * `RegistrantPublic`, so `readRegistrantRoll` had only ever been observed
 * returning `[]`; its `RP.Cid = R.PublicCid` fan-out pin was asserted by source
 * scan alone, and a scan proves the column list, not that the join returns the
 * rows the list describes.
 *
 * Deliberately sequential and stateful against ONE shared fake IndexedDB in one
 * process (the idiom `packages/web-data/test/reattach.test.mjs` documents) — do
 * not reorder or parallelise it. `import 'fake-indexeddb/auto'` first, then
 * `node:test` + `node:assert/strict`. `package.json`'s `test:node` script
 * already runs with `--test-concurrency=1` for exactly this reason.
 *
 * IMPORT NOTE (measured, not assumed): `@votetorrent/web-data` declares NO root
 * export — its `exports` map has exactly `./public` and `./officer`. The
 * connection layer (`createNetworkDb`, `closeNetworkDb`, `deleteNetworkDb`) and
 * the re-attach layer (`assertRowCounts`, `RowCountMismatchError`) are
 * re-exported from `./public`, which is the audience this app belongs to, so
 * every import below comes from that one subpath.

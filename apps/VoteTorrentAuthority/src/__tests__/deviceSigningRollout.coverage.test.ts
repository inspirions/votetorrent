/**
 * deviceSigningRollout.coverage.test.ts — the D-09/D-13/D-14 completeness gate (49-12).
 *
 * 49-11 built the shared `useDeviceSigningErrorHandler` hook and routed 8 call-site files.
 * 49-12 routed the remaining 9. This test is what keeps that rollout complete GOING FORWARD:
 * it derives its inventory of `createDeviceSigner` call sites from the source tree itself
 * (never a hardcoded list), so a future call site added without routing fails THIS suite
 * instead of silently reopening the dead-end gap 49-UI-SPEC.md's degradation clause warns
 * about (an officer whose key is invalidated lands on a raw, unroutable error string with no
 * path back to recovery).
 *
 * Reconciliation this test encodes (so a future reader does not conclude the rollout is short):
 *   - 23 non-test files under `src` reference `device-signer` in some form.
 *   - 21 of those actually INVOKE `createDeviceSigner(` (a call expression, not a comment).
 *   - 18 of the 21 route through `useDeviceSigningErrorHandler` (8 from 49-11, 9 from 49-12,
 *     1 from 50-15's `DashboardSignInCodeScreen.tsx` — the CR-04 presence-proof gate).
 *   - 3 of the 21 are named, justified exemptions (`ROLLOUT_EXEMPT` below).
 *   - 2 files (`engines/registrant-dev-seed.ts`, `engines/signing-proof.ts`) reference
 *     `createDeviceSigner` only in prose comments, never as a call — they are correctly
 *     excluded from the 20-file invocation inventory by this test's comment-stripping walk,
 *     and are NOT part of the 22/20/17/3 arithmetic below (22 = 20 invokers + 2 comment-only).
 *
 * Convention mirrors this workspace's other release-guard-style source-inspection tests (see
 * `engines/__tests__/`): reads files as TEXT rather than importing them, so it fails on what is
 * ACTUALLY on disk (and therefore what `git add` would stage / what Metro would bundle), not on
 * some transformed in-memory representation. (Deliberately not naming a sibling guard test's own
 * filename in prose here — one of those siblings greps the whole `src` tree for its own subject
 * string and a literal filename mention above would trip on itself.)

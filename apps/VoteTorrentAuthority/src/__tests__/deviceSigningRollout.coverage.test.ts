/**
 * deviceSigningRollout.coverage.test.ts — the D-09/D-13/D-14 completeness gate (49-12).
 *
 * 49-11 built the shared `useDeviceSigningErrorHandler` hook and routed 8 call-site files.
 * 49-12 routed the remaining 9. This test is what keeps that rollout complete GOING FORWARD:
 * it derives its inventory of `createDeviceSigner` call sites from the source tree itself
 * (never a hardcoded list), so a future call site added without routing fails THIS suite
 * instead of silently reopening the dead-end gap 49-UI-SPEC.md's degradation clause warns
 * about (an officer whose key is invalidated lands on a raw, unroutable error string with no
 * path back to recovery).
 *
 * Reconciliation this test encodes (so a future reader does not conclude the rollout is short):
 *   - 27 non-test files under `src` reference `device-signer` in some form.
 *   - 25 of those actually INVOKE `createDeviceSigner(` (a call expression, not a comment) —
 *     62-11's lazy ballot-submit signer, now `screens/ballots/EditBallotScreen.tsx` (moved there from CreateBallotScreen by 62-55: the persisted ballot is where submit lives; inventory unchanged at 25), 62-23's
 *     `screens/networks/components/FoundingBundleExportCard.tsx` (the founding-bundle export
 *     signer), and 62-25's `screens/registration/BulkImportSyncScreen.tsx` (the registration
 *     bridge-URL save action) are all among them.
 *   - 23 of the 25 route through `useDeviceSigningErrorHandler` (8 from 49-11, 9 from 49-12,
 *     1 from 50-15's `DashboardSignInCodeScreen.tsx` — the CR-04 presence-proof gate, 1 from
 *     62-11's ballot-submit signer (now `screens/ballots/EditBallotScreen.tsx` after the 62-55 move; routed count unchanged at 23), 1 from 62-23's
 *     `screens/networks/components/FoundingBundleExportCard.tsx`, and 1 from 62-25's
 *     `screens/registration/BulkImportSyncScreen.tsx`), and 2 from 62-27
 *     (`screens/registration/AssociationRequestApprovalScreen.tsx`, the device-change review
 *     ceremony, and `screens/elections/components/ReassociationReviewToggle.tsx`, the D-46
 *     re-association review setting; both route through the hook).
 *   - 2 of the 25 are named, justified exemptions (`ROLLOUT_EXEMPT` below) — unchanged by 62-25.
 *   - 62-25 (D-28/D-29) REMOVES two of the four prior registration-sync exemptions:
 *     `screens/registration/attach-sync-bindings.ts` no longer invokes `createDeviceSigner(` at
 *     all (the bridge-key auto-provisioning loop that called it is deleted — T-62-25-02), and
 *     `screens/registration/attach-association-sync-bindings.ts` is deleted outright (D-28: no
 *     association REST/filesystem app binding exists any more). Neither 62-21's
 *     `attach-peer-sync-binding.ts` nor `officer-intake-key.ts` invoke `createDeviceSigner(`
 *     directly — both take an injected `createSigner` dependency instead (see each file's own
 *     header). 62-25 ADDS exactly one new invoker, `BulkImportSyncScreen.tsx` (routed through the
 *     hook, so ROLLOUT_EXEMPT is unaffected): net effect, the inventory count goes 24 -> 22 (Task
 *     1, the two registration-sync removals) -> 23 (Task 3, the one screen addition) -> 25 (62-27: the
 *     device-change review screen and the re-association review toggle, both routed through the hook).
 *   - 2 files (`engines/registrant-dev-seed.ts`, `engines/signing-proof.ts`) reference
 *     `createDeviceSigner` only in prose comments, never as a call — they are correctly
 *     excluded from the invocation inventory by this test's comment-stripping walk, and are NOT
 *     part of the 25/23/21/2/2 arithmetic above (27 = 25 invokers + 2 comment-only).
 *
 * Convention mirrors this workspace's other release-guard-style source-inspection tests (see
 * `engines/__tests__/`): reads files as TEXT rather than importing them, so it fails on what is
 * ACTUALLY on disk (and therefore what `git add` would stage / what Metro would bundle), not on
 * some transformed in-memory representation. (Deliberately not naming a sibling guard test's own
 * filename in prose here — one of those siblings greps the whole `src` tree for its own subject
 * string and a literal filename mention above would trip on itself.)

 * invocation set from the tree and asserts every non-exempt member routes.
 *
 * 62-25 (D-28/D-29) removes the two prior registration-sync exemptions:
 * `screens/registration/attach-sync-bindings.ts` no longer invokes `createDeviceSigner(` at all
 * (its bridge-key auto-provisioning loop — the only call site — is deleted, T-62-25-02), and

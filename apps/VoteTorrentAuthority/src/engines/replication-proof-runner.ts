/**
 * replication-proof-runner.ts — P2P-06 on-device symmetric replication proof (dev tooling).
 *
 * Symmetric both-write / both-read proof (D-01/D-02): each peer creates a uniquely-named
 * network (`replication-test-<peerIdTail>`) via its own strand-backed session, then polls
 * for the OTHER peer's network. PASS = the peer's network is visible within the bounded
 * poll window; FAIL = timeout.
 *
 * Gated: `__DEV__ && REPLICATION_PROOF_ENABLED` — Metro dead-code-eliminates this entire
 * body in release builds (T-23-03-03).
 *
 * Boots its OWN CadreNode (store `votetorrent-cadre-probe-replication` — OQ2) so it is
 * self-contained and never collides with CadreNodeProvider's `votetorrent-cadre-node`.
 *
 * D-03 fresh-state wipe: `LevelDB.destroyDB` on ONLY the per-network strand store, wrapped
 * in try/catch so a failed wipe is auditable (logged warning) rather than silent (A1 mitigation).
 * The node-identity store (`votetorrent-cadre-node`) is NEVER destroyed (T-23-03-02).
 *
 * Markers emitted (multi-arg — logcat grep must use .* between tag and message):
 *   [replication-proof] starting
 *   [replication-proof] peerId=<id>          (D-05 / P2P-04)
 *   [replication-proof] relayReservation=<true|false>  (D-09 relay-READY; 38-02-locked
 *                                             observable: getMultiaddrs()/p2p-circuit poll)
 *   [replication-proof] strandId=<hash>      (OQ3 handshake)
 *   [replication-proof] peers=N              (D-06 / ENG-05)
 *   [replication-proof] strandPeers=N        (REPL-01 strand-cohort connection count)
 *   [replication-proof] relayAddrsPerDrone=[...], relayAddrsPerDroneCount=N  (D-04 per-drone
 *                                             relay-reservation instrumentation)
 *   [replication-proof] ========== REPLICATION VERDICT: PASS|FAIL ==========
 *
 * Fire-and-forget from index.js. Never throws — all errors caught and logged.
 *
 * Static import only — dynamic require() breaks Metro (Phase 16-07 lesson).

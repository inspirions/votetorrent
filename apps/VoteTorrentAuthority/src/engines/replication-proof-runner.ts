/**
 * replication-proof-runner.ts — P2P-06 on-device symmetric replication proof (dev tooling).
 *
 * Symmetric both-write / both-read proof (D-01/D-02): each peer creates a uniquely-named
 * network (`replication-test-<peerIdTail>`) via its own strand-backed session, then polls
 * for the OTHER peer's network. PASS = the peer's network is visible within the bounded
 * poll window; FAIL = timeout.
 *
 * Gated: `__DEV__ && REPLICATION_PROOF_ENABLED` — Metro dead-code-eliminates this entire
 * body in release builds (T-23-03-03).
 *
 * Boots its OWN CadreNode (store `votetorrent-cadre-probe-replication` — OQ2) so it is
 * self-contained and never collides with CadreNodeProvider's `votetorrent-cadre-node`.
 *
 * D-03 fresh-state wipe: done by `scripts/run-replication-proof.sh` (`wipe_proof_strand_store`),
 * NOT here. The script wipes ONLY the proof strand store, before Step 1 and before the Step-4
 * relaunch, and never before the D-05 relaunch (see section 3 below for why). The node-identity
 * store (`votetorrent-cadre-node`) is NEVER destroyed (T-23-03-02).
 *
 * Markers emitted (multi-arg — logcat grep must use .* between tag and message):
 *   [replication-proof] starting
 *   [replication-proof] peerId=<id>          (D-05 / P2P-04)
 *   [replication-proof] relayReservation=<true|false>  (D-09 relay-READY; 38-02-locked
 *                                             observable: getMultiaddrs()/p2p-circuit poll)
 *   [replication-proof] strandId=<hash>      (OQ3 handshake)
 *   [replication-proof] peers=N              (D-06 / ENG-05)
 *   [replication-proof] strandPeers=N        (REPL-01 strand-cohort connection count)
 *   [replication-proof] relayAddrsPerDrone=[...], relayAddrsPerDroneCount=N  (D-04 per-drone
 *                                             relay-reservation instrumentation)
 *   [replication-proof] ========== REPLICATION VERDICT: PASS|FAIL ==========
 *
 * Fire-and-forget from index.js. Never throws — all errors caught and logged.
 *
 * Static import only — dynamic require() breaks Metro (Phase 16-07 lesson).
 *
 * WRITE-PHASE CHOREOGRAPHY (2026-09-28, debug session p2p11-multi-peer-replication,
 * "User Decisions (checkpoint 3)" — supersedes the earlier bare shoe-in insert):
 *
 * `Authority.InsertValid`'s "very first authority" branch admits exactly ONE unauthorized
 * writer per strand (`count(*) from Authority = 1`, spec'd as the network's one-time root of
 * trust — see `doc/administration.md`). The original proof had BOTH peers attempt that same
 * shoe-in insert, which only one of them can ever satisfy — a proof-authoring oversight
 * (commit `66d9bed7`), not a deliberate design. This write phase now races for that slot for
 * real and drives the REAL invite ceremony for whichever peer loses it:
 *
 *   1. FOUNDER attempt (both peers try this first): insert a real User -> Authority -> Admin
 *      -> Officer (in THIS order — `Officer.AdminValid`'s non-invite branch requires Admin to
 *      already exist, which is why this can't reuse `NetworkEngine.createAuthority()`'s own
 *      Authority -> Officer -> Admin order; that order is correct ONLY for the invite-bound
 *      path it was built for — see the debug session's Option-1 implementation note). Whichever
 *      peer's Authority insert lands first genuinely becomes "the first authority"; then it
 *      issues a real Authority invite via `AuthorityEngine.createAuthorityInvite()` ->
 *      `saveInviteWithSigning('iad', ...)` (a real secp256k1 threshold-signing ceremony,
 *      threshold=1) and publishes an `InviteSlot` for its sibling to find.
 *   2. JOINER fallback (whichever peer's genesis attempt fails, for ANY reason — losing the
 *      Authority race is the expected case, but any other genesis failure degrades to this same
 *      path): poll the shared strand DB for the founder's `InviteSlot`, ensure its own User row
 *      exists (shoe-in if still free, otherwise via the InviteSlot's own invite-bound branch —
 *      `User.InsertValid` carries the identical one-free-slot pattern as `Authority`), accept
 *      the invite via `NetworkEngine.respondToInvite()` (the real authority-accept branch, which
 *      commits the 7-arg Digest `Admin.MutationValid` later recomputes), then create its OWN
 *      authority via the real invite-bound `NetworkEngine.createAuthority(..., { inviteSlotCid,
 *      inviteSignature })`.
 *
 * Both roles set `ownWriteOk = true` on success (section 5/7 false-PASS-fix contract
 * unchanged, see CORRECTION 5 in the debug session file). The read phase (section 6) detects
 * "saw the other peer's contribution" by any `Authority.Id` that is NOT in `ownAuthorityIds` —
 * the SET of every Authority id this peer's own genesis ceremony ever committed (not just the
 * single id it ends up resolving as "mine"; see the leg-6b false-PASS fix, 2026-09-28T20:03,
 * documented at both `ownAuthorityIds`'s declaration in section 5 and `isForeignAuthorityRow`'s
 * declaration in section 6 — a founder attempt can commit its `repl-auth-<tail>` row and then
 * fail LATER in the same ceremony, leaving an orphan that a single-id comparison misreads as the
 * other peer's row), falling back to the old `repl-auth-`-prefix heuristic only when this peer
 * never got ANY id committed (total write-phase failure).
 *
 * Test/harness-only: no schema or product-engine-method change. `NetworkEngine`,
 * `AuthorityEngine`, and the schema are called/read exactly as production code already does;
 * only this proof-harness file's own orchestration grew.

//
// It is removed rather than left dead because it CONSTRUCTED the relay-qualified

// Leaving it would keep a fatal, load-bearing-looking pattern in a file whose relay config is
// the exact thing 0.12.0 changed. Relays are named by `network.relayAddrs` below.

// P2P-11 (41-11, wall #9 — shared-PeerId strand-relay collision): the control node reserves
// through the drone's CONTROL relay, a DISTINCT relay identity from the strand node's STRAND
// relay (strandNetwork below). Two separate relay servers ⇒ each circuit-relay-v2 server holds
// only ONE connection per this peer's (shared) PeerId, so hop-connect (server/index.js:230-236
// connections[0]) can no longer misroute strand streams to the control connection (41-10
// diagnosis §5 — the cadre-core strandNetwork patch unlocks the per-node-type override Probe 1
// proved did not exist before). Placeholder-aware (degrades to [] — no crash, solo boot).
// cadre-core 0.12.0: relays are named by `network.relayAddrs`, NOT by a relay-qualified
// `network.listenAddrs` entry — the old shape is now REJECTED at construction on a control
// node ("network.listenAddrs names a relay directly ... Move the relay to
// network.relayAddrs, which reserves after bring-up").
//
// WHY upstream changed it: a `<relay>/p2p-circuit` listen entry takes libp2p's 'configured'
// route, which dials the relay from inside `libp2p.start()` — during the bring-up quiet
// period that denies exactly that dial, so `listen()` fails and the transport manager's
// FATAL_ALL aborts start. `relayAddrs` takes the 'search' route (one bare `/p2p-circuit`
// listener, no dial) and CadreNode.start() drives the reservation explicitly once the
// control database is up. Failure is still fail-fast: a relay that never answers throws
// RelayReservationFailedError out of start().
//
// Entries are the BARE relay addrs; cadre-core appends `/p2p-circuit` itself. Still routed

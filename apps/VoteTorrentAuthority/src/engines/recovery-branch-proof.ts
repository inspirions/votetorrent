/**
 * recovery-branch-proof.ts — D-26a leg 5, LOCAL half (49-CONTEXT D-26/D-26a)
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * D-26a requires the device-credential recovery branch to be demonstrated on the fleet. As
 * originally specified, that leg is folded into D-24 leg 3's revoke-then-add ceremony, whose
 * success criterion is a replacement key landing in the network `UserKey` table — so it cannot
 * run until a network exists whose `User` resolves with BOTH keys registered. That precondition
 * has been blocked behind an unrelated P2P/relay chain.
 *
 * But the branch itself needs no network. Splitting the leg:
 *
 *   LOCAL  (this file)  — the recovery key signs, via the API-appropriate branch, after the
 *                         signing key has been invalidated, and the signature is accepted by
 *                         the SAME verifier the schema uses. No network, no relay, no drone.
 *   DEFERRED            — `UserKey.DeleteValid`/`InsertValid` accept the revoke+add round trip.
 *                         Genuinely needs network state; rides along whenever one next exists.
 *
 * WHAT THE LOCAL HALF DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE
 * It DOES prove the load-bearing D-26a claim (the branch runs and produces a valid P-256
 * signature) AND the encoding agreement that D-24 leg 1's second sub-claim is about — because
 * it verifies with `verifySigP256`, which IS the function `SignatureValidP256` calls. A
 * hand-rolled noble verify would prove nothing about schema agreement.
 * It does NOT prove the DB write path. Do not record it as closing D-24 leg 3.
 *
 * D-26A RESCOPED 2026-08-21 — API 30+ ONLY
 * Recovery is supported on API 30+ via `BiometricPrompt` + `DEVICE_CREDENTIAL`. Below API 30 it
 * is explicitly UNSUPPORTED: measured n=2 on Device B (Redmi 8, API 29) after a clean `pm clear`,
 * the recovery key is auth-per-use below API 30 and the OS confirm-device-credential API performs
 * a time-bound authentication that cannot authorize it, producing `RESULT_OK` followed by
 * `KeyStoreException: Key user not authenticated`. 49-19 removed the sub-API-30 dispatch branch
 * from the native layer entirely; `signWithRecoveryKey` now rejects with
 * `code: 'RECOVERY_UNSUPPORTED_OS'` below API 30 BEFORE any key handle or UI. See
 * `.planning/todos/pending/2026-08-19-d26-keyguard-fallback-cannot-authorize-per-use-key.md` for
 * the n=2 measurement and the rescope decision. Whether the branch executes AT ALL below API 30
 * was itself settled by measurement, not inference — the `d26a-branch` OS
 * `CONFIRM_DEVICE_CREDENTIAL` activity, observed twice on hardware before the rescope, is the
 * measurement that produced this decision and is preserved in the phase's proof log. This
 * module's remaining value is exercising the API 30+ path (the only one that still exists)
 * without a network.
 *
 * BRANCH ATTRIBUTION IS MEASURED, NOT INFERRED (API 30+)
 * The ceremony script's `recover-branch` leg asserts the SDK>=30 `BiometricPrompt` dispatch by
 * source guarantee. Below API 30 the leg is now `N/A` — there is no branch left to measure or
 * infer, since the native layer terminally rejects before any dispatch decision.

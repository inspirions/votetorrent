/**
 * persistence-proof.ts — Phase 14 on-device proof routine (D-16 / PERSIST-03)
 *
 * Exports two async functions plus a crypto-assertion helper, all driven through
 * a real NetworksEngine constructed with rnDbFactory.  Wire these to dev
 * buttons or a dedicated debug screen — do NOT alter the production screen
 * visual design.
 *
 * D-16 part 1 (superseded by the D-07 full-chain phases below):
 *   runFullChainWritePhase — create Network + Authority + Election via real
 *                    engines with a REAL device user; persist the chain ref to
 *                    AsyncStorage so the read phase can find it after an
 *                    `am force-stop` relaunch.
 *   runFullChainReadPhase  — load the saved chain ref; call networksEngine.open()
 *                    (cache MISS on a fresh process → re-attach via rnDbFactory);
 *                    assert count(*) >= 1 on Network, Authority, and Election.
 *
 * IN-11 (17-REVIEW): the legacy single-table runWritePhase/runReadPhase pair
 * (and their fake PROOF_USER fixture, banned from real flows by T-16-14) were
 * removed — the runner drives only the full-chain phases above.
 *
 * D-16 part 2: on-device crypto-function assertions
 *   assertCryptoFunctions — runs SQL assertions for Digest / SignatureValid /
 *                    isISODatetime and a JS call for H16.  Per RESEARCH Pitfall 6
 *                    SQL-SELECT of H16 does NOT exist in this codebase and MUST
 *                    NOT be called here. Only the four registered functions are asserted.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * TID-REISSUE RECHECK: the on-device, real Hermes/LevelDB confirmation of the
 * durable Tid allocator's no-reissue guarantee (D-15) across the documented real
 * clock-skew vector.
 *
 * Device-attended procedure this phase is designed to run inside:
 *  1. runFullChainWritePhase() runs first — creates a mutation (an Election via
 *     the real signing seam) and records the prior-max 'elections' TidHighWater
 *     under PROOF_TID_REISSUE_BASELINE_KEY.
 *  2. Operator force-stops the app WITHOUT clearing data (`am force-stop`, no
 *     `pm clear`) — the existing full-chain "restart" protocol.
 *  3. Operator rolls the device clock BACKWARD past the recorded prior-max Tid
 *     (the real clock-skew gotcha this proof targets).
 *  4. Operator relaunches the app; this phase runs: re-attaches to the SAME
 *     persisted LevelDB store (via networksEngine.open() → rnDbFactory, D-05
 *     rebind guard — Pitfall 5) and attempts another allocation/mutation (a
 *     second, distinct Election through the real signing seam, consuming the
 *     SAME 'elections' allocator namespace).
 *  5. Asserts the newly-observed 'elections' TidHighWater is STRICTLY GREATER
 *     than the recorded prior max — the durable allocator must never reissue a
 *     consumed Tid, even though Date.now() now reads BEFORE that prior max.
 *
 * This duplicates (rather than shares/refactors) the election-creation steps
 * from runFullChainWritePhase so this phase stays independently self-contained
 * and the existing full-chain write phase is left completely untouched
 * (additive extension, not a harness-architecture rewrite).
 *
 * Emits a single greppable verdict line (see the `passed ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL'`
 * console.info near the end of this function) so the device driver script can
 * gate on it exactly like the other proof-verdict markers in this file.

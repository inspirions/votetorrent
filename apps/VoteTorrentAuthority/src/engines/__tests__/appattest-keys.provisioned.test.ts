/**
 * Phase 51: the embedded Apple App Attest trust anchor.
 *
 * A trust anchor is the one value in this system where a wrong-but-well-formed
 * input does not fail — it silently redefines what "genuine Apple hardware"
 * means. Every other attestation input fails loudly when it is wrong, so every
 * other input can be left to the verifier. This one cannot.
 *
 * These tests do NOT re-verify that the certificate is Apple's. That was done
 * out of band when it was provisioned (see the constant's doc comment, and the
 * chain proof in `vote-engine/test/ios-hardware-attestation.spec.ts`, which
 * checks this same root against bytes a real Secure Enclave produced). What
 * they defend against is the failure mode a human introduces AFTER that check:
 * a truncated paste, a stray character, a base64 body that decodes to
 * *something* and is quietly accepted, or a well-meaning "refresh" that swaps
 * the anchor for a different certificate.
 *
 * The sibling `attestation-keys.secretGuard.test.ts` asserts the Android Play
 * Console keys stay EMPTY in the tracked tree, because those are secrets. This
 * file asserts the opposite for the Apple root, because a CA certificate is
 * public by construction and is meant to be committed. Do not "harmonise" the
 * two: they guard different things in opposite directions.

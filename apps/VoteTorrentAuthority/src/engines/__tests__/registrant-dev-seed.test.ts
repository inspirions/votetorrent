/**
 * registrant-dev-seed.test.ts — Phase 47-23 Task 1 static contract proof,
 * plus the 47-23 continuation's completion-marker regression test.
 *
 * Mostly does NOT construct a real Quereus DB: most of this suite proves the
 * module's CONTRACT (flag-gating, __DEV__ guard, the reserved-range shape
 * of its private literals, that it never hand-rolls signing SQL, and that
 * it never logs a private value) — not the real engine ceremonies, which
 * 47-06/47-07/47-08 already cover against the real engine, and which the
 * on-device walkthrough (47-23 Task 2) exercises for real.
 *
 * The one exception is the 'a partial seed...' test below, which DOES drive
 * `seedRegistrantFixtures` against a hand-built fake `ctx.db` (never a real
 * Quereus DB) with `RegistrationEngine`/`AssociationEngine` mocked via
 * `jest.mock`. It exists to lock the fix for the 47-23 continuation's
 * root-caused bug: the ORIGINAL design gated "already seeded" on
 * `Registrant.Id` for the first registrant existing — a row written in step
 * (3) — so a seed that threw anywhere in steps (4)-(8) was permanently and
 * silently treated as complete. This test constructs exactly that partial
 * state (all registrant rows present, nothing else) and asserts the seed
 * proceeds past step (3) rather than short-circuiting. It is a RED-then-
 * GREEN test: run against the pre-fix module (marker = registrant-0 row
 * existence) it fails, because that design returns at step (1) and never
 * calls `changeStatus`/`enrollElectionRegistrant`/`setElectionAttestationPolicy`/
 * `issueAttestationChallenge`/`associate` at all.

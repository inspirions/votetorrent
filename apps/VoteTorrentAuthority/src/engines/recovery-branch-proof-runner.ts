/**
 * recovery-branch-proof-runner.ts — dev-only boot runner for D-26a's LOCAL half.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget from index.js. No-op unless __DEV__ && RECOVERY_BRANCH_PROOF_ENABLED.
 * Never throws — a failure is logged so the app still boots.
 *
 * Everything is logged under [d26a-local]. Driven by scripts/run-recovery-branch-proof.sh,
 * which also gates on the OS-level CONFIRM_DEVICE_CREDENTIAL activity so the branch is
 * MEASURED rather than inferred from the SDK level.

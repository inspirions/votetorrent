/**
 * app-schema-refusal.ts — tells "this build's schema cannot be applied to the network's data"
 * apart from any other failure to open a network.
 *
 * cadre-core (quereus-plugin-sereus `app-schema.js`) throws `AppSchemaRefusedError` from
 * `addStrand` when this build's declared schema cannot be applied to the network's existing data,
 * and closes the strand. Spike 109 (2026-11-12) measured when that happens on our networks: a
 * `not null` column without a default, or a CHECK one build's rows already break (a member does not
 * check a peer's writes against its own CHECKs). New tables, indexes and nullable columns apply.
 *
 * The data that conflicts lives on the network, not only on this phone, so clearing the app's data
 * would lose this phone's keys and still fail on rejoin. The remedy is a build whose schema fits
 * the network's data: update the app. Nothing is changed on this phone by the refusal (the apply
 * is rolled back; reopening on the previous schema still works).
 *
 * Matching is structural, as in `peer-read-unavailable.ts`: the error `name` (set explicitly by
 * cadre-core, so it survives minification), walking `cause` at most five levels
 * (vote-engine's `NetworksEngine.open/create` wrap the factory error with `cause`). The message is
 * never read or shown.

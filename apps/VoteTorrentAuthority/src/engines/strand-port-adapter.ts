/**
 * strand-port-adapter.ts — Phase 62 Plan 21 (D-32).
 *
 * Wraps the established strand `Database` the engine context already holds into the narrow
 * `{query, mutate, close}` shape `P2pRegistrationTransport`/`P2pAssociationTransport` need
 * (`RegistrationStrandPort` / `AssociationStrandPort` from `@votetorrent/vote-engine/rn`).
 *
 * Four points, kept together because they are one decision:
 *  1. The strand Database is owned by CadreNode/NetworksEngine and is SHARED with every other
 *     engine in the app (`EngineContext.db`). Closing it here would kill the network for the
 *     whole app, not just this transport — so `close()` below is a deliberate no-op that never
 *     touches `db`. This mirrors 62-22's Voter `strand-port-adapter.ts` exactly: the transport's
 *     own `close()` clears its memoized port on top of calling this, so a "closed" port is never
 *     reused by its owning transport even though the underlying Database stays open.
 *  2. This file imports no P2P package (no cadre-core, no db-p2p, no libp2p) and never provisions a
 *     second strand of its own — it wraps a handle `rn-db-factory.ts` already constructed via
 *     `EngineFactory`'s existing strand-backed `DbFactory` path (62-23's screens are forbidden from
 *     provisioning a strand too). This file is engine-layer-only and never opens a strand itself.
 *  3. The transports' staging SQL needs no `with context` clause — the staging tables' own CHECKs
 *     (`SignatureValid`, `DeciderIsOfficerWithScope`, ...) verify every signature/digest at insert
 *     time (62-01), so this adapter is a pure pass-through with no authorization logic of its own.
 *  4. `createStrandPort` is called only from inside `EngineFactory.createPeerStagingTransports` —
 *     never from a screen or binding directly — so the raw strand Database handle never leaves the
 *     factory (the same `exportDashboardSnapshot` rule `engine-factory.ts` already documents).

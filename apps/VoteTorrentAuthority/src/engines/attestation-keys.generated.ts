// attestation-keys.generated.ts — committed default (UNPROVISIONED).
//
// Bundled, clearly-labeled config for the offline device-attestation verifier
// (D-04b / D-10). Two independent snapshots live here:
//
//   1. Play Console key material (decryption + JWS verification keys) that
//      `LocalConfigKeyProvider` reads. EMPTY by default = NOT provisioned. As
//      of D-09 (Phase 47), the empty default is threaded into
//      `PlayIntegrityVerifier`'s `keysProvisioned` constructor parameter — the
//      real verifier still constructs (engine-factory 'association' no longer
//      fails at construction), but `verify()` returns `{ ok: false, reason:
//      'Play Console key material is not provisioned — see SETUP.md' }` while
//      unprovisioned, so the associate() ceremony still fails closed. This
//      replaces the previously-committed all-zero placeholder secrets, which —
//      combined with the pre-CR-01/CR-02 verifier — allowed a full Play
//      Integrity bypass. Provision the real per-app values from secure config
//      as part of the Play Console registration runbook (SETUP.md).
//
//   2. The expected app identity (package name + signing-certificate SHA-256
//      digest allowlist) BOTH attestation halves pin the token/key to (CR-04 /
//      WR-03). `EXPECTED_APP_CERT_SHA256_DIGESTS` are lowercase-hex of the raw
//      32-byte SHA-256 of each accepted signing certificate.
//
// Static import ONLY — dynamic require() breaks Metro (Phase 16-07 lesson).

/**
 * EngineFactory — Phase 15 (D-09/D-12/D-13/D-14 / SWAP-01 / SWAP-03).
 *
 * Single construction point for ALL engines in the app. Lives in the app layer
 * because it holds `rnDbFactory` (RN-specific via rn-leveldb /
 * @optimystic/db-p2p-storage-rn) — per Phase-14 D-03: RN-specific deps MUST NOT
 * appear under packages/vote-engine/.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - One EngineFactory instance per AppProvider (useRef, app-lifetime — D-12).
 *   - One NetworksEngine wrapping the shared LevelDB factory (D-10).
 *   - Sibling engines are lazily built and cached by name (+JSON-serialized initParams).
 *   - clearEngineCache() wipes ALL cached engines for a clean switch (D-14 uniform clear-all).
 *
 * Security: factory holds ctx internally; screens receive only IXxxEngine instances.
 * getEstablishedContext result never returned to AppProvider/screens (T-15-03-04).
 * factory never calls rnDbFactory(hash) twice — only via networksEngine.open()/create()
 * which is cache-first (T-15-03-05 / Pitfall 2).

/**
 * registrant-dev-seed.ts — `__DEV__`-guarded, flag-gated registrant fixture
 * (Phase 47-23 Task 1, marker fixed in the 47-23 continuation).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (47-23-PLAN.md `<blocking_precondition>`): zero UI in this
 * app can create a registrant — `IRegistrationEngine.register()` is a real,
 * fully-implemented `'vrg'`-signed multi-row ceremony, but registration
 * request/approval flows are Phase 48's scope. Six of the nine Phase 47
 * surfaces (registrants list, registrant detail, private tier, status
 * change, associations, challenges, and the election roster's filtered rows)
 * are therefore unwalkable on a fresh device without seeded data. This
 * module is that data — nothing more. It is never reachable from any UI
 * control, and the committed tree ships it OFF (`REGISTRANT_SEED_ENABLED`
 * in `proof-flags.generated.ts`).
 *
 * Direct analog: `apps/VoteTorrentVoter/src/engines/dev-seed.ts` (Phase
 * 44-06) — same `__DEV__` throw guard, same "no hand-rolled signing SQL"
 * rule. This module differs in one structural way: it does NOT create the
 * network/authority/election — the D-15 walkthrough creates those through
 * the real Add Network / Create Election UI (47-23-PLAN.md leg A0), because
 * a successful network creation under the nine-code `FOUNDING_OFFICER_SCOPES`
 * seed IS the D-15 evidence this walkthrough exists to capture. This module
 * only seeds what happens AFTER that: registrants, a status spread, an
 * election enrollment, an attestation policy, two challenges, and one
 * association.
 *
 * COMPLETION-MARKER FIX (47-23 continuation, root-caused by the orchestrator
 * before this file was touched): the ORIGINAL design gated the "already
 * seeded — no writes" shortcut on `Registrant.Id = <first registrant's id>`
 * existing. That row is written in step (3); the status spread, enrollment,
 * attestation policy, challenges and association are steps (4)-(8). If the
 * seed threw ANYWHERE in (4)-(8), the marker row already existed, and every
 * later launch logged the "already seeded" line and skipped the unfinished
 * work FOREVER — the marker claimed completion of work it did not gate. This
 * is now fixed two ways:
 *   1. The completion signal is a DEDICATED AsyncStorage key
 *      (`seedCompletionKey`, below), written ONLY as the LAST statement of a
 *      successful run — after step (8), not step (3). AsyncStorage (not a
 *      DB row) so the marker cannot be confused with, or accidentally
 *      satisfied by, any of the seed's own data rows; the same pattern this
 *      app already uses for `persistence-proof-runner.ts`'s completion
 *      tracking. Keyed by `networkRef.hash` so seeding a second network
 *      never reads a stale marker from a different one.
 *   2. Every write in steps (3)-(8) is now individually idempotent (an
 *      existence check before each write), because "the completion marker is
 *      absent" can now mean EITHER "never started" OR "started and crashed
 *      partway" — and a re-run must resume, not re-throw on a primary-key
 *      collision against rows a prior partial run already wrote.
 *
 * Do NOT hand-roll any signing-ceremony SQL here — every mutation below goes
 * through a real `vote-engine` method (`RegistrationEngine.register` /
 * `changeStatus` / `enrollElectionRegistrant`, `AssociationEngine.
 * issueAttestationChallenge` / `associate`, `RegistrationEngine.
 * setElectionAttestationPolicy`) that owns its own Digest / admin-signing /
 * admin-signature ceremony internally. The app layer only ever supplies a
 * `SignCallback` — never a raw private key, never a raw admin-signing row
 * write, and never a schema-CHECK-context signature bypass flag. A
 * hand-rolled row write would bypass the very CHECK this walkthrough is
 * trying to prove (T-47-23-07). The idempotency guards above are plain
 * `select` reads — never a hand-rolled `insert`/`update`.
 *
 * Logging discipline (T-47-23-02, a hard constraint, not a style note):
 * every `console.*` line this module emits carries counts, registrant ids,
 * and step names ONLY. No `PrivateDetail`, no `RegisterInit`, and no caught
 * error object that could embed one may ever be passed to `console.*` — a
 * caught error is always logged as `err instanceof Error ? err.message :
 * String(err)`. If this module's own output leaked a private value, it
 * would poison Task 2's logcat grep and either manufacture a false T-47-02
 * failure or mask a real one.

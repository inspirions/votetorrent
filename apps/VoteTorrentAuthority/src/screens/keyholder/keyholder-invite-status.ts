/**
 * What a keyholder's `InviteStatus` says. `result` is set only from a real `Keyholder` row (the
 * invitee ACCEPTED) or an `InviteResult`, so it means "responded". The election engine's keyholder
 * projection also reports `sent` (live | answered | declined | no-longer-valid | unknown) read from the
 * invitation slots, which is what lets the officer see "Sent" before any response. The engine ranks
 * every invitation sent to one name, so after "send again" the newest live one decides.
 *
 * - response wins: accepted / declined regardless of `sent`
 * - sent declined: declined. A decline writes no Keyholder row, so the engine never sets `result` for
 *   it; `sent` is the only carrier. A newer live resend outranks the decline and reads sent.
 * - live, or answered without a visible result yet (replication lag): sent
 * - no-longer-valid covers cancelled, expired and superseded invitations: "no longer valid, send again"
 * - unknown is the fail-closed reading of an ambiguous invitation or an invitation table the network
 *   could not serve. It is deliberately NOT "not sent": the invitation may well exist.
 * - no slot found: not sent
 *
 * The copy for every label key below lives in the locale file.

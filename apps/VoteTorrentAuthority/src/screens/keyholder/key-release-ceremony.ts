/**
 * key-release-ceremony.ts — keyholder share release ceremony (D-17, D-20). Never throws.
 *
 * Four points:
 *  1. D-20 entry path: the ceremony is only reachable from a release-key task in the Tasks inbox,
 *     and those tasks exist only once the election timeline has entered `releasingKeys` (the
 *     release engine's pull-and-seed, run by `getKeysToRelease(true)`). Nothing here seeds,
 *     schedules or polls.
 *  2. D-17 effect: a successful run leaves one public, signed `KeyholderShareRelease` row under the
 *     KEYHOLDER's own identity key. The signer ALWAYS accompanies the completion call: a call with
 *     no signer is refused by the engine (`signer-required`), and this ceremony never uses the
 *     officer's device key.
 *  3. Prompt budget: a first release performs exactly two auth-required vault unwraps (the share,
 *     then the signing key), both under the keyholder wrap key. A repeat on an already-released
 *     task performs zero; a device that does not hold the task's keyholder identity performs zero
 *     and writes nothing, because the identity lookup runs before the engine or the vault is touched.
 *  4. This module never reconstructs a key (D-16): it only publishes one share.
 *
 * The outcome carries a machine code, never an error message, so nothing here can leak an identifier
 * into a screen.

/**
 * registration-bridge-config.ts — Phase 62 Plan 25 (D-29). Read/save of the Authority's
 * registration REST bridge URL, mirroring `officer-intake-key.ts`'s never-throw model pattern
 * field for field.
 *
 * D-29: the URL lives in the signed, replicated `AuthorityIntakePolicy` — every officer device
 * and the Voter (62-22) read the SAME value through `IntakeEngine.readIntakePolicy`. There is no
 * local, device-only configuration of any kind.
 *
 * A `'vrg'` threshold above 1 refuses with `IntakeError('threshold-requires-co-sign')` (62-14/
 * 62-13 GAP: this table has no co-sign Task path yet). This module reports that refusal as
 * `'co-sign-required'` — a TERMINAL outcome for the mount, never a retryable failure — so the UI
 * never offers a "Try again" that would just refuse identically again.
 *
 * The stored URL is world-readable (CLASS.PUBLIC, 62-01) — it is a sync endpoint, not a secret.
 *
 * This module never clears the saved URL: the 62-UI-SPEC defines no "clear bridge URL" action, so
 * an officer currently cannot turn the REST bridge back off from the app once a URL is saved. That
 * gap is recorded in this plan's SUMMARY as an open question, not solved here.
 *
 * No signer resolution happens in this file — the hosting screen resolves the device signer, so a
 * resolution failure routes through its own `useDeviceSigningErrorHandler`. No `console.`. Error
 * codes are read STRUCTURALLY (`name === 'IntakeError'` and a string `code`), never with
 * `instanceof` (Metro can duplicate a class across bundle chunks, breaking `instanceof` checks).

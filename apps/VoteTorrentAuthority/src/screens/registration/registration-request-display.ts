 *
 * Disambiguation rule this ladder participates in (UI-SPEC §Color): `warning`

 * *bridge-signed* — a provenance fact. The two never share a shape (pill vs.
 * border) or a position (top-right, same-row pill vs. full-height left edge),
 * so a bridge-signed pending request legitimately carries `colors.warning` in
 * two places at once without conflating them.

/**
 * The single, pure observed-vs-claimed timestamp rule the row and the

 *
 * - `submittedAt` is **submitter-chosen**: a *claim*, carried inside the
 *   request's own signature. It has to be submitter-chosen or an offline
 *   courier's pre-resolved signature could never verify against DG-1
 *   (48-05's L-3). It is therefore attacker-controlled input, bounded only
 *   by 48-07's skew guard (no more than 5 minutes after, or 30 days before,
 *   intake).
 * - `receivedAt` is the **authority's own observation**, written at INSERT,
 *   inside NO digest, and the key 48-08's triage queue sorts by — so the
 *   timestamp a row shows by default is the same clock that decided where
 *   that row sits in the queue.
 * - Therefore, when only one value is shown, the one shown is `received` —
 *   NEVER the claim. A lone timestamp on a registration-request row is
 *   always authority-observed.
 * - `claimed` is returned ONLY when the two differ at the rendered
 *   precision, so the row never prints two identical date strings (pure
 *   noise, and noise on this row competes with the D-03 marker for a
 *   hurried officer's attention) and ALWAYS prints two differing ones.
 *   Divergence is the visible case by construction — exactly the case
 *   T-48-05-09 / T-48-07-12 / T-48-08-11 accept the residual risk on the
 *   strength of.
 * - This function performs no masking and no logging, and it never swaps
 *   the two members.
 *
 * Comparison is on the FORMATTED strings, never the raw ISO values, so what
 * this function decides and what the officer sees can never disagree.

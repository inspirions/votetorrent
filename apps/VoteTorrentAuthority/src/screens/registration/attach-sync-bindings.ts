// Metro runs with unstable_enablePackageExports: true (metro.config.js), so any bare-specifier
// deep subpath (e.g. "@votetorrent/vote-engine/dist/registration/transport/...") is BLOCKED by
// that map in both Metro and Jest (jest.config.js's own moduleNameMapper comment confirms:
// "The package exports field blocks subpath access"). A literal RELATIVE path bypasses "exports"
// entirely — that field governs bare-specifier package-name resolution only, never a relative
// import — and this exact target was verified module-by-module to contain zero runtime
// node:fs/node:http/other-Node-builtin references: rest-registration-transport.js -> utils.js ->
// database/initialize.js -> database/schema-sql.js + database/tid-allocator.js. schema-sql.js's

// the file was regenerated, not a runtime import.
//
// D-29 (62-25), superseding WR-17's build-time gate: through 62-24 this loader was additionally
// `__DEV__`-gated, because the bridge target was a hardcoded, un-shippable constant — a one-line
// edit to that constant was all it took to turn a release build into a live outbound sync client
// (48-32's commit 70c40b7, reverted by 4c1b231). That hazard is now closed a different way: the
// bridge target comes ONLY from the signed, replicated `AuthorityIntakePolicy` a `'vrg'` officer
// sets through a schema ceremony (`registration-bridge-config.ts`), re-validated https at every
// sync (see `syncNow` below). There is no longer a source-editable constant to protect, so the
// `__DEV__` gate is removed from both this loader and `attachSyncBindings` — a shipped build now
// loads this transport unconditionally, the same way 62-22 made the Voter's REST path unconditional.
// The require keeps a LITERAL path string: Metro cannot resolve a computed specifier, and a
// resolution failure must stay a loud build-time error rather than becoming a silent runtime one.
// It stays `require` rather than a dynamic `import()` because this attachment must remain
// synchronous (`attachSyncBindings` returns `void` and is called from a `useEffect`).

/**
 * attach-sync-bindings.ts — the production registration REST bridge (D-29, Phase 62 Plan 25).
 *
 * This file is the RN-side attachment site `bulk-import-sync-model.ts` (48-20) deliberately did
 * NOT own: it constructs the REST-constructible binding (`RestRegistrationTransport`, 48-10) and
 * registers it into `registerSyncBinding('rest', ...)` so the device leg's "Sync Now" is a real
 * network call, never a simulation.
 *
 * D-29: the bridge is now a PRODUCTION option. `syncNow` reads the bridge target from the
 * replicated, signed `AuthorityIntakePolicy` at the START of every sync (never cached across
 * syncs) through `IntakeEngine.readIntakePolicy`, so every officer device and the Voter (62-22)
 * read the same value. A build with no saved URL simply refuses before any network call — see
 * `RestBridgeConfigCard`'s own doc comment for the officer-facing side of this contract.
 *
 * THE AUTHORITY-SIDE BRIDGE CONTRACT this file reads and writes (a throwaway dev bridge in this
 * tree, `scripts/device-proof/association-rest-bridge.mjs`, serves it for device-proof sessions;
 * a production bridge implements the SAME shape):
 *   - `GET {url}/staged-requests` -> `{ staged: StagedRequestJson[] }`. A `bridgeKeys` member, if
 *     present, is IGNORED — see the no-provisioning note below.
 *   - `GET {url}/registration-decisions` via `RestRegistrationTransport.pollDecisions()` — the
 *     locked R-3 wire format, each notice `{ requestId, status, reason?, decidedAt, cursor }`.
 *   - `POST {url}/registration-decisions` with `{ requestId, status, reason?, decidedAt }` — so a
 *     REST-route voter (62-22) can learn the authority's decision the same way a peer-route voter
 *     reads it off the strand.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MUST NEVER DO (each load-bearing, each mechanically gated):
 *   - Never import `filesystem-registration-transport` (48-09) — that module imports
 *     `node:fs/promises` and is deliberately unreachable from the RN bundle (Phase 44's `@peculiar`
 *     device-boot wall cost two plans to unstick; jest is structurally blind to this class of
 *     failure because jest runs on Node, where the import resolves fine).
 *   - Never register a `'peer'` id at this seam — that severance belongs to 48-20/48-23/62-21 and
 *     this file does not spend it.
 *   - Never auto-provision a `RegistrationBridgeKey` from a bridge listing (T-62-25-02). Through
 *     62-24 this file provisioned any bridge key a listing named, signed by the device's own
 *     unattended local signer — an unattended officer signature over a key NAMED BY A REMOTE
 *     SERVER is a silent trust grant, not a legitimate provisioning path. That loop is deleted:
 *     bridge-issued documents now intake only when their key was registered by another path (the
 *     `'vrg'` ceremony), and fail their `BridgeIdValid` CHECK otherwise — reported by id, never by
 *     message text.
 *
 * THE INTAKE PATTERN this file implements for REST mirrors, field for field, the pattern
 * `filesystem-registration-transport.ts`'s own `IRegistrationRequestIntake.readStagedRequests` doc
 * comment already documents for the filesystem binding: "hand each result to
 * `RegistrationEngine.submitRegistrationRequest(doc.init, doc.requesterKey, doc.signature)` —
 * passing the already-resolved Signature, never a callback, because the authority does not hold
 * and must never hold the requester's key." `RestRegistrationTransport` implements only the
 * SUBMITTER-facing `IRegistrationRequestTransport` (submitRequest/pollDecisions) — it declares no
 * authority-side intake interface of its own (48-10 left that gap open). This file bridges that
 * gap with a small, NON-locked-protocol listing fetch (`GET {baseUrl}/staged-requests`), then
 * applies the SAME documented hand-off to the local engine.

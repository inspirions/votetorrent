/**
 * RegistrationRequestApprovalScreen — the ceremony where an authority
 * officer actually decides a registration request (D-03/D-06/D-07).
 *
 * (1) This is a STANDALONE screen reached by its own route
 * (`RegistrationRequestApproval`, wired by 48-21). It deliberately adds NO
 * `'registrant'` branch to `SignatureTaskScreen.tsx`'s `titleKey` record or
 * its `signatureType` switch — that file is byte-unchanged by this phase.
 * What is reused from it is the ceremony SHAPE only: fetch the
 * engine-authoritative digest via `getSignatureDigest` -> sign with the
 * device-signer callback -> call the completion method -> `navigation.goBack()`,
 * with `InlineError` as the sole failure surface. The reason this is a
 * separate screen is D-07: the verification checklist is a screen-local gate
 * `SignatureTaskScreen.tsx` has no equivalent of, and bolting a seventh
 * branch onto a switch serving six unrelated ceremonies would put the
 * checklist one refactor away from every other signature type.
 *
 * (2) The render order below is a safety property, not a layout preference.
 * `BridgeSourceCallout` renders first because D-03 requires a bridge
 * assertion to be unmissable. `PriorRejectionsCallout` renders directly
 * beneath it, above the summary and the checklist, because an officer who
 * never scrolls past a re-submitted request must still see that this person
 * was refused before (D-06).
 *
 * (3) Never-log rule: the request summary renders unmasked — an officer
 * cannot honestly complete the D-07 checklist against a masked value, so
 * masking would make the checklist dishonest. The compensating control is
 * that no payload value, no `rejectionReason`, and neither `read.submittedAt`
 * nor `read.receivedAt` ever reaches `console.*`, an `errorMessage`, an i18n
 * interpolation, or a crash payload — the same contract Phase 47's
 * `RegistrantDetailScreen` states for `RegistrantPrivate`. This file
 * deliberately contains ZERO `console.*` calls — a divergence from
 * `SignatureTaskScreen.tsx`, which does `console.warn` on its own catch
 * branches: that screen's tasks carry no registrant PII, this screen's
 * summary does.
 *
 * (4) `useCurrentOfficerScopes()` here is a UI legibility convenience, not a
 * security boundary. `AdminSigning.SignerKeyValid` and
 * `OfficerSignature.OfficerValid` are hardcoded stub CHECKs, and
 * `AdminSigning.UserIdValid` requires the signer to be some officer at the
 * authority, not one scoped to any particular value — a pre-existing,
 * cross-cutting gap tracked under Phase 999.1 and out of scope here. This
 * file makes no claim anywhere that write access is scope-gated at the data
 * layer; `canDecide` decides only which write controls render `disabled`.
 *
 * (5) D-44 / D-11 (62-27). `PossibleDuplicateCallout` renders beneath the prior-rejections
 * callout. A request closed (or closing) as a duplicate renders its own block, and its Approve and
 * Reject controls stay present but disabled. Each decision is published right after it resolves,
 * through `RegistrationEngine.publishRegistrationDecision` with `closesRequestId` set to the
 * callout candidate or null (never omitted); a publish failure never reports the recorded decision
 * as failed, and 62-25's drain publishes it later. At a vrg threshold above 1, Reject records a
 * vote through the officer's own registrant task (62-11 refuses a single-officer
 * `rejectRegistrationRequest` above threshold 1); the reason is not collected, because whether to
 * persist it is an open question. No screen calls a transport's `publishDecision`.
 *
 * (6) D-49 (62-31) seals the payload per officer. An unread payload renders an explicit
 * unreadable state in place of the summary and checklist, never an empty form. The copy is
 * 62-10's Group K; the approval gate's `RegistrationContentAccessError` is mapped by its access
 * code, and its message (request id plus access code) is never rendered.

 * `labelKey` (`KNOWN_REQUEST_FIELD_LABEL_KEYS`); any other field name carries
 * a humanized `label`, never the raw key.
 *
 * Rows 1 and 2 are the provenance pair and they LEAD the summary — this
 * ordering is a safety property, not a layout preference. `submittedAt` is
 * submitter-chosen, a claim carried inside the request's own signature and
 * attacker-controlled within 48-07's skew bound; `receivedAt` is the
 * authority's own observation, inside no digest, and the key 48-08's triage
 * queue is ordered by. T-48-05-09, T-48-07-12 and T-48-08-11 all ACCEPT a
 * misstated `submittedAt` on the explicit ground that the officer can see
 * the divergence, and this screen is where the decision is actually made —
 * so the pair sits above every payload field, where an officer who never
 * scrolls still sees it. BOTH rows are emitted unconditionally, in every
 * mode, even when the two values are equal — this screen applies NO
 * divergence threshold (unlike 48-14's list row) and never calls
 * `resolveRowTimestamps`: that threshold exists to protect the D-03 marker's
 * weight in a dense list, and a detail screen has no such budget. Never emit
 * one value under the other's row key, and never merge the two into one row.
 *
 * This function performs no masking, no truncation of payload values (other
 * than the final `requesterKey` row, which truncates the same way every
 * other truncated-key surface in this app does), and no logging.

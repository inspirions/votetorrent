/**
 * ProvisionSigningKeyScreen — D-14's dedicated first-run and recovery signing-key surface.
 *
 * signingKeyProvisioning — this file's own D-14/D-16/D-18 marker (see 49-UI-SPEC.md's
 * "Screen Composition Reference" and "ProvisionSigningKeyScreen" contract, exact).
 *
 * D-14 boot invariant (explicit, load-bearing): this screen is reached ONLY by an explicit
 * Settings press (`reason: 'first-run'`) or an explicit catch-and-navigate from one of the 22
 * `createDeviceSigner` call sites (`reason: 'invalidated'`, 49-11/49-12). It is NEVER
 * auto-navigated-to during provider construction or cold start, and no signer is ever resolved
 * here as a side effect of merely rendering. `AppProvider.tsx`'s lazy factory (its own
 * comment block, ~line 199) is the reason: resolving a signer — or, by the same logic,
 * redirecting to a signer-setup screen — during boot can turn a successful re-attach into a
 * spurious "Failed to load network". This file must never be imported by `AppProvider.tsx`.
 *
 * D-15 two-stage registration (Gap A closure, 49-17): first-run onboarding is
 * network-independent by construction (49-16), so the first `UserKey` cannot always be
 * registered through the schema's first-key bootstrap branch FROM THIS SCREEN — a `pm clear`
 * device has no network `User` row to attach it to yet. That bootstrap branch
 * (`count(*) = 1 and context.UserKey is null`, `packages/vote-core/schema/votetorrent.qsql`
 * `UserKey.InsertValid`) is exercised by `networks-engine.create()` on the network-creation
 * path instead; this screen's stage 2 exercises it only when it finds a network `User` with no
 * keys yet (the join-network path). The recovery key always registers through the signed
 * subsequent-key path, authorized by the signing key.
 *
 * D-08: the provision-time attestation cert chain is captured (via `produceAttestation`) and
 * persisted (49-16's `persistDeviceProvisioningRecord`) — it is the only mechanism that ever
 * makes user presence verifiable in-schema, and capturing it now avoids re-provisioning keys
 * later. The X.509 chain proves hardware and key continuity, never user identity; same-user
 * continuity across provisioning events is the deferred master-password item, not this screen's
 * job. Unlike the Voter app's device-association flow (45-05), there is no server-issued
 * challenge nonce in this ceremony, so the bound digest is self-issued over a locally generated
 * nonce plus the new key's own public value.
 *
 * DEVICE-PROOF HONESTY: jest cannot exercise the real Android Keystore or `BiometricPrompt`. This
 * screen's own test suite proves the JS-side wiring and rendering against a faked native module
 * ONLY — not that provisioning works on real hardware. That proof is D-24 leg 1 (49-13/49-18) and
 * leg 3 (49-14).

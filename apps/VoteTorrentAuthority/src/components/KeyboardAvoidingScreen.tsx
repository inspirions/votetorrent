/**
 * Drop-in replacement for the `<View style={styles.content}>` shell that every
 * form screen uses as its outermost element. Identical layout when no keyboard
 * is showing; while one is up it pads the bottom by the keyboard's height, so
 * the flex children above it (the ScrollView and the pinned {@link Footer})
 * shrink to the space that is actually visible.
 *
 * That padding is what restores scrolling: the ScrollView's viewport ends at
 * the top of the keyboard instead of behind it, so its maximum scroll offset
 * grows by the keyboard's height and the fields underneath can be reached. It
 * also lifts the footer's Save/Create button into view instead of leaving it
 * stranded behind the IME.
 *
 * Single source of truth on purpose — same reasoning as `Footer`. The padding
 * has to be applied by the app because `adjustResize` no longer resizes the
 * window under Android's forced edge-to-edge; see {@link useKeyboardInset}.

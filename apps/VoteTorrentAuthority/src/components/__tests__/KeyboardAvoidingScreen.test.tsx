/**
 * KeyboardAvoidingScreen — the app's answer to Android's forced edge-to-edge.
 *
 * The manifest asks for `windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"`, but an app that
 * targets SDK 35 is forced edge-to-edge from Android 15 onwards, and in
 * edge-to-edge the platform stops resizing the window for the IME. The
 * ScrollView viewport (and so its maximum scroll offset) therefore never
 * shrinks: reproduced on a Pixel 8 emulator (API 37) against Add Network,
 * where six full-length swipes could not bring the last three fields or the
 * CREATE footer above the keyboard, because the list was already at max
 * offset.
 *
 * The invariant these tests pin is the one that fixes that: the screen shell
 * pads its own bottom by exactly the keyboard's height, so the flex children
 * above it end at the top of the keyboard rather than behind it.
 *
 * `Keyboard.addListener` is stubbed rather than driven through the real
 * emitter — the RN jest preset has no IME to raise events, and stubbing keeps
 * the assertions on OUR contract (what we do with a reported height) instead
 * of on RN's emitter internals.

/**
 * useCurrentOfficerScopes — D-10 forward officer walk (device → Officer).
 *
 * Inverts the reverse walk `EditOfficerScreen.tsx:51-71` already performs
 * (officerId → Officer). Given an authorityId, this hook answers "what
 * scopes does THIS device hold at THIS authority?" by joining the device's
 * own identity (`getOrCreateDeviceUser().id`) against the authority's
 * officer roster (`Officer.userId`) — the same join key EditOfficerScreen
 * walks in the other direction.
 *
 * NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY (T-46-03): this gate is a convenience/legibility
 * affordance ONLY. The real control is the DB-side 'mel'-scoped
 * AdminSignature CHECK (MutationValid/DeleteValid on the
 * ElectionRegistrationField/ElectionDisclosurePolicy/ElectionAttestationPolicy
 * tables), which rejects an unsigned or wrong-scope mutation regardless of
 * what this hook returns. A caller that ignores this hook entirely cannot
 * thereby write anything — there is no code path here that gates a write
 * itself; this hook only returns raw data.
 *
 * WR-05 caveat: `OfficerInit` (vote-core/src/authority/models.ts:114-134)
 * carries no per-officer `userId`, so `NetworkEngine.createAuthority` binds
 * `ctx.user.id` to every seeded officer row. That makes the `userId` match
 * below trivially correct for the single-officer path that exists today,
 * but a genuinely second officer device will find NO matching row and be
 * gated read-only — which is honest given the current data model, and will
 * need revisiting when true multi-officer authorities land.
 *
 * `undefined` vs `[]` contract: `undefined` means no matching Officer row
 * (or the walk failed) — this is ALSO the pre-load value, so callers must
 * check `loading` before rendering a "you are not an officer" message. `[]`
 * means a real officer holding zero scopes. Callers must distinguish these
 * two states; do not default the missing case to an empty array.
 *
 * Scope-agnostic by design (D-10): the hook returns the officer's raw,
 * unfiltered `Scope[]` and never mentions `'mel'` in executable code, so
 * Phase 47 can reuse it verbatim for `'vrg'`/`'cap'` — each caller derives
 * its own `canWrite` as `!loading && scopes?.includes('mel') === true` (or
 * whichever scope it needs).

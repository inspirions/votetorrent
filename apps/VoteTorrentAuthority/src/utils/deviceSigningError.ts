/**
 * deviceSigningError.ts — D-13 device-signing error taxonomy contract (49-01,
 * Wave 0 scaffolding).
 *
 * Single source of truth for mapping `signWithDeviceKey`'s native rejection
 * `code` to a UI class. Every one of this phase's 22 `createDeviceSigner`
 * call sites routes its catch block through `mapDeviceSigningError` rather
 * than re-deriving the mapping locally (see `49-UI-SPEC.md`
 * §Cross-Cutting: Error Taxonomy Contract).
 *
 * Pure TypeScript — no React Native, native-module, or navigation imports,
 * so it is fully jest-testable and importable from any call site without
 * pulling in the bridge.
 *
 * Analog: `apps/VoteTorrentVoter/src/engines/attestation-failure.ts` (Phase
 * 45's D-09 code -> UX class mapper). This file is one taxonomy tier deeper
 * (routes by exact code, not just a 3-way class) and does NOT reproduce
 * that analog's `__DEV__` terminal-class downgrade — this phase's taxonomy
 * has no release-only terminal class (StrongBox/TEE absence is Phase 45's
 * D-07 concern, not this phase's).

 * recognizes a Quereus CHECK-constraint rejection naming `SignatureValid` — the schema's own gate
 * correctly rejecting a signature whose `signerKey` (bound from stale local `deviceUser`
 * metadata) no longer matches the private key that actually produced it. This is the SHAPE an
 * interrupted `handleRecovery` leaves behind: `provisionDeviceKey` (step 1, unprompted) already
 * regenerated the Keystore-resident `SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS`, but the paired
 * `persistProvisionedDeviceUser` write (the final step) never ran, so `device-signer.ts` signs
 * with the NEW key while reporting the OLD one.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT folded into `DeviceSigningErrorClass`/`CODE_TO_CLASS` above: this failure never
 * touches `signWithDeviceKey`'s native reject path at all — it fires from the routine per-use call
 * sites' own engine writes (`ElectionsEngine`/`UserEngine`-style `rethrow` wrapping, or the raw
 * `ConstraintError` unwrapped when the CHECK is evaluated as a deferred constraint — both shapes
 * are handled, since this reads the error's MESSAGE, not a `code` field).

 * `\bSignatureValid\b` (word-boundary-anchored) deliberately excludes `InviteSignatureValid` (a
 * different table's, different-signing-path CHECK with the same substring) so this predicate
 * stays scoped to the device signing key, not every signature-shaped CHECK in the schema.
 *
 * This is the RESCUE half of the fix — it works even for a device whose desync PREDATES this
 * predicate's existence (no `deviceSigningRecoveryInProgress` marker was ever written for it,
 * e.g. an interruption that happened before this code shipped): the officer's next routine sign
 * attempt fails this exact way regardless of marker state, and `useDeviceSigningErrorHandler.ts`
 * routes that failure back into `handleRecovery` (`reason: 'invalidated'`), which self-heals
 * unconditionally — see `device-user.ts`'s `DEVICE_RECOVERY_IN_PROGRESS_KEY` doc comment for the
 * PREVENTION half (`device-signer.ts`'s `isRecoveryInProgress()` fail-closed check for FUTURE

// D-09 / RESEARCH Open Question 2: the cold-start re-attach race is REMOVED,
// not survived. Before this plan, the init effect called
// `factory.setNode(node)` with whatever `node` happened to be on the
// CURRENT render — on cold start that is unconditionally `null` on the
// FIRST render, because CadreNode.start() is async and has not resolved
// yet. That guaranteed first attempt at `node === null` routes to
// `rnDbFactory` and dies at `networks-engine.ts`'s `isSchemaInitialized`
// gate. Adding `node` to the effect's dependency array papered over the
// race with an implicit SECOND attempt once the boot completed — but
// nothing distinguished "still booting" from "boot already failed", both
// of which present identically as `node === null` forever, so a failed
// boot left the app re-attempting on `rnDbFactory` and never noticing.
//
// The fix awaits `CadreNodeProvider`'s `nodeSettled` (D-08) BEFORE the
// first `factory.setNode(...)`, so the unconditional first attempt at
// `node === null` never runs at all — there is exactly one dispatch,
// against the backend actually settled on.
//
// Open Question 2 — does the await need its own timeout? YES, and this is
// the answer, not a retry knob: `nodeSettled` awaited unbounded would be a
// NEW availability defect — a hung `CadreNode.start()` would strand the
// officer on the splash screen forever, with no error view and therefore
// no Try Again (T-58-05-02). `NODE_SETTLE_TIMEOUT_MS` bounds the wait;
// the loser of the race RESOLVES to a `'timeout'` status (never rejects),
// so a merely-slow boot degrades to the solo backend instead of surfacing
// "Failed to load network" — a worse outcome than attempting solo. 15000ms
// is three orders above the sub-second solo boot (`.start()` does not
// block on peer discovery) and one third of `AddNetworkScreen.tsx`'s
// `CREATE_TIMEOUT_MS = 45000` — the tolerance already applied to a
// user-initiated wait; a passive cold-start wait must be shorter. This
// value is a liveness ceiling chosen from reasoning, not a device
// measurement — 58-08's D-08 re-measure should record the real settle
// duration so it can be revisited with a number.
//
// D-09 also rejects bounded RETRY (`loadAuthoritiesWithRetry.ts` is
// deliberately not reused here): retrying re-attempts the SAME ambiguous
// signal this plan removes, it does not resolve it.

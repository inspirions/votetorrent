 * timeline-fixtures.ts -- Phase 59 plan 59-07, Task 1.
 *
 * Production-length strings + the ten-row view-model builder shared by `TimelineRow.test.tsx`
 * and `TimelineRail.test.tsx`. Deliberately under `__fixtures__/`, NOT `__tests__/` -- jest's
 * default `testMatch` treats every file under a `__tests__` directory as a suite, and a helper
 * module there fails with "must contain at least one test".
 *
 * `buildTenRowFixture` calls the REAL `deriveTimeline` adapter (59-06) rather than hand-rolling a
 * join -- this plan consumes 59-06's derivation, it never reimplements it. `buildRowFixture` is a
 * lighter single-row builder for `TimelineRow.test.tsx`'s per-stage/per-status behavior
 * assertions, which do not need a full, mutually-consistent ten-row rail.
 *
 * Trap (D-23(f)): this file is a plain `.ts` under `src/`, so
 * `src/__tests__/no-vrg-ceremony.gate.test.ts`'s source walk scans it -- it must never contain a
 * real `register(`, `associate(`, `seedSignedMutation` or `issueAttestationChallenge` call. It
 * does not.

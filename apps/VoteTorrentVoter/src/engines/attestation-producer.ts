/**
 * attestation-producer.ts — D-03/D-11 device-side attestation PRODUCER seam
 * (Phase 44-03, reshaped to the two-step seam in Phase 45-05).
 *
 * This is the boundary between "the screens drive attestation production" and
 * "that value is handed to `AssociationAssociateBuilder.setAttestation(...)`".
 * `44-PATTERNS.md` confirms neither app has a prior instance of a *producer* type
 * (only the pre-existing *verifier* seam, `StubAttestationVerifier` /
 * `USE_STUB_ATTESTATION_VERIFIER`, has an analog).
 *
 * D-11 two-step seam: `provisionDeviceKey()` generates/returns the hardware-backed
 * P-256 public key BEFORE the authority-issued challenge exists; `produce(challenge)`
 * then answers that challenge. Phase 45's `createRealAttestationProducer` (from
 * `@votetorrent/attestation-native`) implements this exact shape — no navigation/
 * engine re-wiring here (44-08/45-06 own the screen wiring; do NOT construct
 * AssociationEngine here).
 *
 * T-44-08 (Spoofing, mitigate) / T-45-05-04 (CR-03): the stub producer is reachable
 * ONLY when `__DEV__` is true AND `USE_REAL_ATTESTATION_PRODUCER` is false (the
 * committed default). Outside `__DEV__`, `resolveAttestationProducer()` (with no
 * real producer supplied) returns the REAL producer via
 * `createRealAttestationProducer({ enablePlayIntegrity: resolvePlayIntegrityEnabled() })`
 * (real by default; D-12 independent stub tier via `USE_STUB_PLAY_INTEGRITY`) — never
 * the stub — mirroring the authority app's `USE_STUB_ATTESTATION_VERIFIER` / CR-03
 * fail-closed posture (`apps/VoteTorrentAuthority/src/engines/engine-factory.ts`'s
 * `'association'` case).
 *
 * 45-09-gap / D-12: `USE_REAL_ATTESTATION_PRODUCER` (via `resolveRealProducerForced()`)
 * additionally lets a `__DEV__` build reach the REAL producer — Metro live-reload stays
 * intact while real hardware key attestation runs — WITHOUT weakening CR-03: the
 * predicate is `__DEV__ && USE_REAL_ATTESTATION_PRODUCER`, so it is unconditionally
 * `false` in a release build no matter the flag's value, and the release rung below is
 * completely unchanged.
 *
 * Plan 11 addition (D-02/D-18): the voter's self-signed association-request messages must
 * carry a signature that verifies directly against the P-256 key `provisionDeviceKey()`
 * returned (the schema's own check compares the signature to that exact public key, not to
 * any registered identity). `signDeviceKeyDigest` is the seam for that.
 *
 * Plan 51-14 CLOSED the gap plan 11/51-11/51-13 flagged: the real hardware-backed producer
 * (`createRealAttestationProducer`, `@votetorrent/attestation-native`) now implements
 * `signDeviceKeyDigest` via the existing `native.signWithDeviceKey` TurboModule call (the same
 * primitive the iOS path already used for its §4 proof-of-possession step) — it is no longer
 * stub-only. The method stays declared OPTIONAL on this interface for structural flexibility
 * (a caller-supplied producer/test fixture that only implements `provisionDeviceKey`/`produce`
 * remains valid TypeScript, e.g. `attestation-producer.test.ts`'s drop-in-override fixtures) —
 * but any producer actually used for the association ceremony MUST implement it. A caller must
 * treat its absence as "cannot self-sign," never silently skip it (`ConfirmationScreen.tsx`'s
 * `associationSign` guard does exactly this, unchanged by 51-14).

/**
 * dev-seed.ts — D-05/D-07/D-08 dev-only network/authority/election/policy fixture
 * (Phase 44-06).
 *
 * DECISIVE RESEARCH FINDING THIS MODULE OPERATIONALIZES (44-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 1):
 * `RegistrationEngine.register()` signs BOTH the row-level `Registrant.Signature`
 * digest AND the `vrg`-scoped `AdminSigning` ceremony with the SAME signer — and
 * `AdminSigning.UserIdValid` requires that signer's `signerUserId` already be a row
 * in `Officer` for the target authority. Neither a throwaway voter keypair nor the
 * libp2p/CadreNode peer key (`loadOrCreateRNPeerKey`) satisfies this — that key is
 * NEVER inserted into User/Officer/UserKey (44-RESEARCH.md Anti-Patterns).
 *
 * Resolution: this seed makes the device's own resolved identity (`device-user.ts`/
 * `device-signer.ts`, from 44-02) the network's FOUNDING OFFICER via
 * `NetworksEngine.create()`'s first-authority branch (`votetorrent.qsql` Officer.
 * InsertValid: "part of the very first authority in the network — no invite, no
 * signing"). The SAME device signer then signs `register()` — one identity, two
 * roles (voter + authority officer), matching the project's local-single-device
 * dev posture (D-04/D-07).
 *
 * The seed also writes `ElectionRegistrationField` policy rows — one per tier
 * (public/private/selective) — via the real `RegistrationEngine.
 * addElectionRegistrationField` (Phase 42-07). An empty policy table makes
 * `validateFieldPolicy` a silent no-op (`field-policy.ts:96`, Pitfall 5); this seed
 * deliberately avoids that gap so D-08's "policy enforced for real" claim holds.
 *
 * Do NOT hand-roll any signing-ceremony SQL here — every mutation below goes
 * through a real `vote-engine` method (`NetworksEngine.create`, `ElectionsEngine.
 * seedElectionSigning`/`seedElectionRevisionSigning`/`createElection`,
 * `RegistrationEngine.addElectionRegistrationField`) that owns its own Digest/
 * AdminSigning/AdminSignature ceremony internally. The app layer only ever
 * supplies a `SignCallback` — never a raw private key, never a raw AdminSigning
 * INSERT, and never a schema-CHECK-context signature bypass flag.
 *
 * `__DEV__`-guarded and idempotent: re-running against an already-seeded network
 * (matched by name in `getRecentNetworks()`) re-attaches and returns the existing
 * network/election instead of re-creating them; the policy rows are only inserted
 * once (a second `addElectionRegistrationField` for the same (ElectionId,
 * FieldName) would violate that table's primary key).

	// (1) Founding-officer network. `admin.officers[0].init.scopes` is `['mel']`
	// ONLY (D-09/D-20) — 'vrg' (Scope.vrg = "Validate registrations",
	// votetorrent.qsql:59) is DELIBERATELY NOT granted here. 'vrg' is the
	// authority's registration-ceremony scope; granting it to the device's own
	// user is exactly what let the voter app run the authority's ceremony
	// (D-01 — see 51-CONTEXT.md / 51-11-SUMMARY.md). 'mel' (Scope.mel = "Manage
	// Elections") stays — the election + per-tier policy-row ceremonies below
	// need it, and D-12's `ElectionRecordValidityPolicy` row is 'mel'-scoped.
	// Officer.InsertValid's first-authority branch needs no invite, no signing
	// for officer #1 — networksEngine.create(networkInit, deviceUser) makes the
	// device user that officer directly (the Officer row's UserId binds to the
	// `user` param, not to anything in OfficerInit — OfficerInit carries no
	// userId field, see votetorrent.qsql:164-210 / networks-engine.ts:84-125).
	//
	// Honesty note (D-09 gate research): `AdminSigning.UserIdValid`
	// (votetorrent.qsql:247-252) only checks that the signer is SOME Officer
	// row at this authority+AdminEffectiveAt — it does not join against
	// `Officer.Scopes` at all, and no engine-side check does either
	// (`registration-engine.ts`'s own doc comment on `rejectRegistrationRequest`
	// says so verbatim: "this method never claims the scope is enforced").
	// Dropping 'vrg' therefore does NOT, by itself, make THIS identity's
	// `register()` calls fail at `UserIdValid` — the device user remains an
	// Officer of this authority regardless of which Scopes it carries. What
	// removing 'vrg' DOES do: it stops this fixture from asserting/documenting
	// a grant that was only ever needed to imitate the authority's own
	// ceremony, and keeps a future reader from treating 'vrg' as an obvious,
	// convenient scope to restore. The real structural backstops against a
	// reintroduced voter-side ceremony are (a) the comment-stripped source gate
	// (`no-vrg-ceremony.gate.test.ts`) that fails on any reintroduced
	// `register(`/`associate(`/`seedSignedMutation`/`issueAttestationChallenge`
	// call under `apps/VoteTorrentVoter/src`, and (b) the fact that a genuine
	// (non-dev-seed) voter identity — one never inserted into `Officer` at all —
	// fails `UserIdValid` for real, which the same gate file also proves.

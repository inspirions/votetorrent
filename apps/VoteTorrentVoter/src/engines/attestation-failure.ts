/**
 * attestation-failure.ts — D-09 three-way failure classifier for the device-side attestation
 * ceremony (`DeviceAttestationScreen`'s pre-`register()` capability probe and
 * `ConfirmationScreen`'s challenge/produce round-trip, Phase 45-06).
 *
 * The native producer (45-01/45-02/45-05) rejects with a stable `code` string. This module maps
 * that code to one of three UX classes so the screens never have to branch on raw codes:
 *
 *   - `'terminal'` — the device fundamentally cannot vote (no StrongBox/TEE, failed integrity,
 *     failed provisioning). No retry; the voter is stopped.
 *   - `'recoverable-action'` — the voter can fix this themselves (enroll biometrics) and retry.
 *   - `'recoverable-transient'` — a retry alone might succeed (network hiccup, lockout timeout,
 *     an unrecognized/future code). This is also the safe DEFAULT for any unknown code — a
 *     mystery error must never permanently wall a voter.
 *   - `'no-election'` — there is no election on this phone to register for (a
 *     `NoElectionConfiguredError`, thrown before any device step). Retry is not offered.
 *   - `'intake-unavailable'` — the device is fine, but the vote-engine intake refused to hand the
 *     request to the authority (an `IntakeError`, e.g. `no-recipients` when the authority has no
 *     officer able to receive it yet). Blaming the device here misleads the voter; the copy
 *     instead says the authority can't take the registration right now. Retry stays available.
 *
 * Release-only terminal invariant (D-09/D-07): a terminal-class code is downgraded to
 * `'recoverable-transient'` whenever `__DEV__` is true, so the emulator (which has no real
 * StrongBox/TEE) is never walled by this classifier. This downgrade is UX-ONLY — it does NOT
 * weaken the real fail-closed enforcement, which lives entirely in
 * `resolveAttestationProducer()`'s release branch (always returns the real producer, never the
 * stub, per CR-03) and in the native build never taking the D-07 dev-stub rung in a release
 * artifact. `__DEV__` here can only ever make the UX *more* permissive in a debug build; it
 * cannot be reached in release.

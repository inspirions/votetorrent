/**
 * dev-seed-timeline.test.ts — D-13 (phase 61, plan 61-05) Tier-1 coverage.
 *
 * 61-05 widened `dev-seed.ts`'s seeded timeline so the honest long-remainder countdown case is
 * reachable on hardware: `registrationEnds` 25d->52d, `ballotsFinal` 14d->40d, `votingStarts`
 * 2d->31d, all three moved TOGETHER. Until this file, that requirement's ONLY evidence was a
 * one-off manual device sanity pass recorded in `61-05-SUMMARY.md` — no automated gate asserted
 * either of D-13's two must-have truths, and `dev-seed.test.ts` contains no timeline reference at
 * all. A later edit could pull `votingStarts` back on its own (exactly the mistake `dev-seed.ts`'s
 * own comment warns against) and nothing in the 57-suite voter run would have gone red.
 *
 * Measured through the PRODUCT's own read chain, not by scanning the source literal:
 * `seedDevNetwork` -> `ElectionsEngine.openElection` -> `getElectionDetails()` ->
 * `details.current.timeline` -> `deriveTimeline` — the identical chain `TimelineScreen.tsx`'s
 * read effect walks. A source-text scan would pass even if `parseTimeline` rejected the blob;
 * reading the derived rows cannot.
 *
 * Tier boundary: this is Tier 1. It proves the seeded INSTANTS and that the view-model resolves
 * confidently over them. It does NOT prove anything rendered on a device — no Yoga pass runs
 * here. See `61-VALIDATION.md`'s Two-Tier Contract.

/**
 * App-local, future-engine-shaped interfaces for VoteTorrentVoter's provider (D-04).
 *
 * The election/ballot shapes below are the voter's view-models over the REAL engine read surface
 * (`engines/election-read.ts`: `IElectionsEngine` -> `getElectionDetails()` / `getBallots()` /
 * `getBallotDetails()`). Fields with no engine source yet (voting progress, keys released,
 * validation checks/fingerprint, certification) are OPTIONAL and left absent in a real read —
 * never faked. The `__DEV__` lifecycle override fills them from `devLifecycleFixtures.ts` so
 * every card state can still be design-reviewed.
 *
 * Phase 44 (D-02/D-04/D-07): `VoterAppContextType` now ALSO carries the real composition
 * root's surface (`getEngine`/`hasEngine`/`selectNetwork`/`hasNetwork`) mirroring the authority
 * app's `AppProvider`, plus the D-07 dev-seeded `seededElectionId` the registration seam reads.
 * The three former registration/voted-status mock booleans (and their setters) are REMOVED from
 * this context — the real registration flow (real `Registrant` rows via `RegistrationEngine`)
 * replaces them; any screen that still needs a local registered/voted flag now owns it as
 * component-local state (see `RegistrationScreen.tsx`/`HomeScreen.tsx`/`ReviewSubmitScreen.tsx`).
 *
 * 51-12 (D-09/D-20): the context's `sign` field (the founding-officer device signer,
 * `DevSeedResult.sign`) is REMOVED. `ConfirmationScreen.tsx` was rewritten by 51-11 to never
 * destructure `useVoterApp().sign` — it is dead plumbing, and dead plumbing that hands out an
 * officer-capable signer is exactly the kind of "obvious, convenient" surface a future
 * contributor could wire back into a reintroduced admin-signed ceremony (T-51-12-02). Removing
 * it here means there is no `sign` left on this context to wire back in the first place —
 * `DevSeedResult.sign` itself is UNCHANGED (dev-seed.ts / dev-seed.test.ts still need it as the
 * seed's own election/policy-row signer).
 *
 * Voter/Registration/Ballot-selection shapes that have no `vote-core` analog stay app-local
 * here — they are NOT promoted to `vote-core` this phase (D-04, REQUIREMENTS Out of Scope).
 * This module must never import from `vote-core` (a bare `NetworkReference` type import is
 * fine — that is a pure type-only re-export, not a runtime dependency on vote-core).

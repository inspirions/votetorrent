/**
 * seed-election-surface.test.mjs -- the seed fixture's row-count and
 * negative-control assertions, split out from election-phase.test.mjs in
 * 53-05 (D-25) when election-phase.js itself moved to
 * packages/ui-web/src/lifecycle/election-phase.js. Its subject is the
 * dashboard's OWN test/fixtures/seed-election-surface.js against a real
 * in-memory database, not the moved module -- hence the honest rename: a
 * dashboard file still named election-phase.test.mjs that no longer tests
 * election-phase.js would be exactly the decoy shape D-11 rejects for a
 * re-export shim.
 *
 * In-memory `new Database()` + `prepareDb` (no IndexedDB) -- these run
 * against the real 59-table schema, not a mock.

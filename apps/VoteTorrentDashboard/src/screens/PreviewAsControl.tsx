/**
 * PreviewAsControl.tsx — the nine-scope "Preview as" control (D-18) and its
 * provider.
 *
 * This control exists because the only real officer this phase can have
 * holds all nine scopes — the schema admits exactly one user through the
 * unsigned founding shoe-in (`User.InsertValid`'s `count(*) = 1` clause),
 * and a second officer needs the deferred invite ceremony — so without this
 * control the scope gate (`../auth/gate.js`) would otherwise never be
 * observed doing anything. The gate function is never stubbed: only the
 * scope set handed to it, produced by `../auth/preview-scopes.js` and
 * carried through `GrantedScopesContext`, ever varies. A previewed set is a
 * preview of what an officer WOULD see, not a change to what anyone is
 * allowed to do — there is no write path in this phase for it to affect.
 *
 * Also re-exports `AdvisoryDisclosure` (`./AdvisoryDisclosure.js`) so
 * `DashboardShell.tsx`'s bounded wiring edit needs one import line instead
 * of two. This is a disclosed consolidation for that edit's hard line
 * budget, recorded in the plan's summary — not a restructuring of either
 * component's own module boundary; both still live in their own dedicated
 * files exactly as the plan's artifact list requires.

/**
 * GrantedScopesContext.ts — the single seam `PanelGrid.tsx` reads for the
 * effective (real-or-previewed) scope set that reaches `evaluate()`.
 *
 * The PROVIDER lives in `./PreviewAsControl.tsx`, not here. The plan
 * permits either file for `PreviewAsProvider`; this file picks
 * `PreviewAsControl.tsx` deliberately, for two reasons: (1) that is where
 * `../auth/preview-scopes.js`'s `toggleScope`/`resetToReal`/`badgeKey` are
 * already imported to drive the checkbox control's own state, so building
 * the context value there needs no second copy of that wiring; and (2) it
 * lets `DashboardShell.tsx`'s bounded wiring edit pull `PreviewAsProvider`,
 * `PreviewAsControl` and (re-exported) `AdvisoryDisclosure` from ONE import
 * line instead of three, which matters for that edit's hard line budget.
 * This file owns only the context object and the two hooks that read it.
 *
 * `useEffectiveScopes()` returning the DEFAULT (an empty array) rather than
 * throwing when called outside a provider matters: a panel grid that
 * renders before the shell mounts a provider must degrade to rendering
 * nothing, never crash.

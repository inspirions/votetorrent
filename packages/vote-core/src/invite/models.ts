 * public `signingKey`, the public `dkgPublicKey`, and a `sign` callback that signs with the
 * private half of `signingKey.key` on the caller's side.
 *
 * - `signingKey`: the fresh keyholder identity's OWN public signing key (type 'M' or 'P', a
 *   future expiration) — D-21: never the inviting officer's key, never reused across accepts.
 * - `dkgPublicKey`: the 66-char hex compressed secp256k1 DKG share-encryption RECEIVING key
 *   (62-05's `generateDkgReceivingKey().publicKey`) — never the joint election key.
 * - `sign`: signs a digest with `signingKey`'s private half. `respondToInvite` calls this BEFORE
 *   opening the accept transaction (never holds a transaction open across a signing prompt) and
 *   verifies the returned `signerKey` equals `signingKey.key` before writing anything.

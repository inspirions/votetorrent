 * is a pure string/byte transform so it can run identically on the registering device (encode),
 * the re-associating device (normalize/format) and the authority (constant-time compare).
 *
 * The code is 50 bits (Crockford base32, 10 characters) — deliberately short enough to be

 * replicated, officer-visible `AssociationRequestStaging` row (D-45), and an unmatched code never
 * auto-approves (D-46) — there is no silent oracle a guesser can probe faster than the authority
 * can see the attempt.

/**
 * serve-dist.mjs — a static file server over a BUILT directory, for the
 * shared browser-gate runner (D-19/D-24). `vite dev` is never a gate (see
 * `run-ui-gates.mjs`'s own header); this module is what serves a real
 * `vite build` output instead.
 *
 * Path containment (T-53-08-05, ASVS V5/V12): every request path is decoded
 * from `new URL(req.url, 'http://localhost')`'s `pathname` and resolved
 * against `rootDir`. That URL parsing step already collapses literal `..`
 * segments (and percent-encoded `%2e%2e` forms — the WHATWG URL "double-dot
 * path segment" rule matches both), which is what makes a NAIVE decode-then-
 * resolve safe against the obvious case. The real gap this containment check
 * exists for is a request that hides its `..` from that same URL parser by
 * percent-encoding the SEPARATOR rather than the dots — `..%2f..%2f..%2fetc`
 * survives the URL parser's dot-segment collapse as one opaque path segment
 * (it does not equal the literal string `..`, so the collapse rule does not
 * fire), and only becomes `../../../etc` once THIS module's own
 * `decodeURIComponent` call runs on the extracted pathname, after the URL
 * parser has already finished normalising. The `path.relative` containment
 * check below is what catches that second, later escape — proven by
 * `test/serve-dist.test.mjs`'s traversal case, which sends the `%2f`-encoded
 * form for exactly this reason: a plain `../` in a request URL never reaches
 * this server unresolved, because the client-side `new URL()`/`fetch()` call
 * that builds the request already collapses it before the bytes go out.
 *
 * That lexical containment check alone is NOT sufficient (WR-15): it runs on
 * the resolved-but-unfollowed request path, so a symlink whose LEXICAL
 * location sits inside `rootDir` but whose TARGET resolves outside it sails
 * straight through -- the request path itself need contain no `..` at all.
 * `readFile`/`stat` then follow that symlink at the OS level and would serve
 * the outside file's bytes. This module closes that gap with a SECOND
 * containment check, run on the `realpath()` of the resolved path (which
 * follows symlinks), after `stat` confirms the entry exists and before
 * `readFile` ever touches it -- proven by `test/serve-dist.test.mjs`'s
 * symlink-escape case.
 *
 * `serveDist(rootDir, port)` takes the port as a required parameter with no
 * default — the runner owns port policy. A bound port is a loud failure,
 * never a silent fallback: this module attaches an `error` listener to the
 * HTTP server BEFORE calling `listen`, and rejects the returned promise with
 * the underlying `EADDRINUSE` (or other) error rather than retrying,
 * incrementing, or passing `0` to let the OS choose. A runner that quietly
 * served on a different port would be a runner whose log claims to have
 * gated a page nobody asked for.

/**
 * three-bucket-absent.test.mjs — D-07's zero-occurrence scan: the function
 * spike 086 used to map the four-phase model back onto this repo's old
 * three-bucket vocabulary has zero occurrences of its own name anywhere in
 * product code under `apps/` and `packages/`, while surviving exactly once
 * in comment form (its audit trail) in `election-phase.js`'s header. THIS
 * FILE NEVER SPELLS THAT NAME OUT LITERALLY EITHER -- see below.
 *
 * The hunted identifier is never written as a literal ANYWHERE in this
 * file — it is assembled at runtime by joining two fragments and matched
 * with a `\b`-anchored `RegExp` built from that value. This is not
 * decoration: this file lives under one of the two roots it scans, and the
 * failure it exists to prevent — a checker whose own source contains the
 * pattern it greps for, and which is therefore PERMANENTLY GREEN — has
 * recurred three times in this repo (Phase 53). Case 6 below asserts this
 * file's own source contains zero occurrences of the assembled identifier,
 * structurally, not merely by convention.
 *
 * Scan roots: `workspacePath('apps')` and `workspacePath('packages')`,
 * skipping `node_modules`/`dist`/`dist-gate`/`build`/`coverage`/`.git` and
 * any `test`/`__tests__` directory. Test files legitimately NAME this
 * identifier in matchers (`election-shell.test.mjs`'s `PHASE_54_FORBIDDEN_RE`
 * still does, until 54-10 retires it) — scanning them would make this check
 * permanently red for the wrong reason. D-07's claim is about PRODUCT CODE,
 * and the exclusion is what makes the claim precise rather than what makes
 * it pass.
 *
 * Comment stripping is deliberately one-directional: block comments and
 * whole comment LINES are stripped, but a trailing same-line `//` comment
 * is NOT — distinguishing a real trailing comment from a `//` inside a URL
 * or string literal would risk deleting real code and hiding a real
 * occurrence. Over-reporting is the correct failure direction for a
 * zero-occurrence scan.

/**
 * chart-contracts.ts — types, colour strings and the hard-coded geometry
 * constants every chart primitive in this directory shares (60-03).
 *
 * No JSX, no React import: this file is the frozen contract wave 3/4
 * consumers build against, not a component.
 *
 * The colour strings below are the SECONDARY colour path described in
 * 60-03-PLAN.md's objective — the `var(--…)` string handed to a Recharts
 * colour prop, which resolves if Recharts forwards it verbatim. The PRIMARY
 * path is a class name on every mark with its rule declared in
 * `components.css` (D-15) — that path wins even when Recharts substitutes
 * its own default fill, so the mechanism survives either behaviour. No hex
 * literal appears anywhere in this file or any sibling under this directory.
 *
 * The geometry constants are hard-coded here and never read from a spacing
 * token, per 60-UI-SPEC's own "Spacing Scale" exceptions list — a bar cap,
 * a stroke width, a surface gap and the two meter heights are mark geometry,
 * not layout spacing.

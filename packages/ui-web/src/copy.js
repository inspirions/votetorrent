/**
 * The shared copy table for VoteTorrent's web apps.
 *
 * Two web consumers read this table: `apps/VoteTorrentDashboard` (the authority
 * officer's dashboard) and `apps/VoteTorrentPublic` (the no-login public election
 * view). The two React Native apps -- `apps/VoteTorrentAuthority` and
 * `apps/VoteTorrentVoter` -- are NOT consumers of this table and keep their own
 * `src/i18n/` tables.
 *
 * Contract C2 (binding, frozen by 50-04-PLAN.md): one flat frozen record `COPY` with
 * dotted string keys, plus `t(key, params)`. This is still the ONLY place any
 * user-facing string in either web app may live -- `scripts/lint-copy.mjs` fails the
 * build if a binding sentinel string appears anywhere else under `src/`.
 *
 * Transcribed verbatim from 50-UI-SPEC.md's Copywriting Contract.
 *
 * The "no later plan adds a key" rule above is a rule about PLANS, and it held:
 * the table was complete for every screen this phase built. It is not a rule
 * that a defect may not be fixed. Code review found user-facing text rendered
 * OUTSIDE this table in two places -- the raw machine phase codes in
 * `screens/Bootstrap.tsx` and the `tier`/`site(s)` pills in
 * `screens/panels/PanelFrame.tsx` -- and the fix for each is a key here, which
 * is exactly what contract C2 demands. Every such addition is recorded in a
 * comment beside the keys it adds.
 *
 * D-08: this table is no longer complete-and-frozen for all time. `public.*`
 * keys arrive under that prefix as `apps/VoteTorrentPublic` actually mounts each
 * screen that needs one -- never speculatively -- and each addition is recorded,
 * per the existing convention above, in a comment beside the keys it adds.
 *
 * D-08, AMENDED for the public election view's fact/gap table (54-09). The
 * `public.*` block at the bottom of this file now arrives one to five waves
 * BEFORE the screens that mount it. The "never speculatively" rule is not
 * waived; it is satisfied by a different warrant, because a speculative key
 * is one nobody has committed to mounting, and none of these is:
 *   - 50 of them are named by `FACT_COPY_KEYS`, a frozen, derived, tested
 *     export of `src/lifecycle/facts.js`. That export is computed from the
 *     fact model itself, its completeness is asserted in `test/facts.test.mjs`,
 *     and `test/copy.test.mjs` iterates it -- so the set is a landed contract,
 *     not a guess about a future screen.
 *   - the remaining 11 are each named by a locked phase decision or by an
 *     already-planned call site that binds them BY NAME (see the per-group
 *     comments beside them).
 * `t()` throws on an unknown key, so authoring them late would turn every
 * render plan into a render failure; authoring them here is what makes the
 * render plans mountable at all. The residual this leaves -- a key that
 * ships and then is never actually mounted -- is closed by the render plans
 * themselves, which gate their own output against this same contract, and by
 * `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/test/node/election-shell.test.mjs`'s bidirectional
 * declared-vs-mounted case, whose interim allow-list must shrink to empty as
 * each of the eleven is mounted.
 *
 * D-07 (variant-prop contract): a component SHARED between the two web apps must
 * not hard-code one consumer's copy key. It takes an explicit `variant` prop and
 * resolves its own key at render time, so `t()`'s throw-on-unknown-key turns a
 * missing public voice into a loud render failure instead of a silent wrong
 * answer. This closes a real defect: a shared `AdvisoryDisclosure` component
 * rendered "What's shown here follows the officer's permissions…" on a no-login
 * public page with no officer and no permission model to speak of -- with clean
 * imports, a green typecheck and every other gate green, caught only by looking
 * at a screenshot. A `public.*` value must be authored FRESH for a no-login
 * audience and must never be derived by find-and-replace from a `gate.*` or
 * `bootstrap.*` string. The residual control is a manual per-consumer copy
 * review, because every automated gate in this repo is provably blind to a
 * false-but-well-formed word.
 *
 * D-10: `50-UI-SPEC.md` remains the design authority for the dashboard's half of
 * this table, but it is no longer the sole authority -- the table now also
 * serves an app that spec never described.
 *
 * Contract C3 (D-17): there is deliberately NO `read-only` / `◐` panel-state string in
 * this table. Nothing in this phase is writable -- every panel in this phase is either
 * fully visible (granted scope) or fully hidden (withheld scope) -- so a read-only
 * badge would describe a state that cannot occur. `scripts/lint-copy.mjs` fails if a
 * `/read-only/i` match ever appears in any value.
 *
 * Contract C4: the four `50-UI-SPEC.md` "Producer screen (RN app)" copy rows are NOT
 * transcribed here. They belong to `apps/VoteTorrentAuthority`'s own
 * `src/i18n/index.ts` and are owned by plan 50-07. A web bundle must not ship a React
 * Native screen's strings.
 *
 * 53-05's key-naming resolution (D-07 vs D-09, this plan's own open question,
 * resolved in favor of D-07 for this one shared component): (1) the D-07
 * `variant` prop resolves `advisory.<variant>.body` by TEMPLATE LITERAL, not
 * a lookup map; (2) `gate.advisoryDisclosure` was RENAMED to
 * `advisory.authority.body`, its value carried across byte-identical; (3)
 * this is the ONLY key renamed by this plan -- the other 72 keep D-09's
 * byte-identical guarantee untouched; (4) the template form is chosen over a
 * lookup map because a map admits a one-token `?? 'advisory.authority.body'`
 * fallback that would silently restore the authority voice on the public
 * app, and no test in this repo could see it -- a template literal has
 * nowhere to put that token; (5) `advisory.*` is a variant-paired namespace
 * owned by ONE shared component, whose two members are the two voices of
 * one sentence and neither exists without the other -- `public.*` remains
 * the public app's own namespace for keys with NO authority sibling; (6) the
 * deferred `authority.*`/`public.*`/`shared.*` re-prefixing declined at D-09
 * remains declined -- this is a scoped exception for one paired variant, not
 * the first stone of that rewrite. `50-UI-SPEC.md` is NOT the authority for
 * the `advisory.*` pair; this file's own header is.

	// WHAT DEFECT THIS CLOSES: one hedging sentence was the dashboard's answer
	// to three different service refusals AND to a locally malformed paste. An
	// officer reading it could not tell a typo from a code whose single use was
	// already spent from one that simply sat too long, and the single action it
	// offered -- ask for a new code -- is the wrong instruction for the first
	// of those.
	//
	// WHY THIS PRECISION IS AVAILABLE AT ALL -- READ THIS BEFORE SHORTENING THE
	// SERVICE'S RETENTION WINDOW: the rendezvous service erases a code's
	// ciphertext as soon as it is served, but deliberately KEEPS the
	// payload-free record for a grace window past the code's expiry. That
	// retention is the only reason a late redemption is still answered
	// precisely ("already redeemed" / "timed out") instead of collapsing to the
	// weakest answer, "no record here". These three keys are what that
	// retention buys. Shorten the window and this file quietly regresses to one
	// hedge for every refusal -- the exact defect above -- with no test to
	// notice, because each key would still resolve.
	//

	// lints this block for banned lexemes (officer/permission/scope/login

	// no claim tied to any one election.
	//
	// REWRITTEN by 54-09. The value shipped by 53-07 was FALSE, and in two
	// distinct ways, both of them consequences of the same fact: this app's
	// only data source is the election records this particular browser
	// already holds.
	//   (1) It promised that whoever opens the page sees the election
	//       record. A first-time visitor's browser holds no record at all,
	//       so for them the page shows nothing -- the promise is not merely
	//       imprecise, it is wrong for the commonest visitor.
	//   (2) It promised that the page never shows different visitors
	//       different things. What any visitor sees depends entirely on
	//       their own browser's holdings, so two visitors routinely see
	//       different pages.
	// It is not enough to note this in a plan: the reason a well-formed
	// sentence like that one survived review and shipped is that no
	// automated gate in this repo can see a false word, so the correction
	// has to live where the next author will read it.
	//
	// The replacement carries exactly three claims, and they are the only
	// three that stay true across the move from today's read-once store to
	// real-time sync: the page shows the election's OWN PUBLISHED RECORD;
	// it shows the SAME RECORD to every visitor WHOSE BROWSER HOLDS IT; and
	// NOTHING DONE HERE CHANGES IT. It deliberately makes no claim about
	// reach -- how far a record travels, who else can get one, whether the
	// two web apps share a store. There is no replication layer anywhere in
	// the web tree, and the origin topology of the two web apps is an open
	// question, so any sentence about reach would be unverifiable today and
	// could be falsified whichever way that question resolves. A claim this

	// Per-fact card labels, one per `FACTS` entry, taken from spike 088's own

	//   rules       -- was "Election rules", which duplicated its own group
	//                  heading almost exactly.
	//   ballot      -- was "The ballot", byte-identical to its group heading,
	//                  so the card looked like a repeat of the heading above
	//                  it.
	//   turnout     -- was "Ballots cast / turnout"; a slashed pair is a
	//                  label that could not decide, and "turnout" adds
	//                  nothing a reader of "Ballots cast" does not have.

	//                  to say that check is unavailable, so its label must
	//                  not offer it.

	// remedy that cannot work. That is the same class of defect as the

	//         state name.
	//   (iii) Its GATE, which is the part a render site can get wrong: it
	//         belongs to the loaded result's own completeness flag being
	//         false, and NEVER to a count of unreadable networks. A registry

	//         no result at all while loading, so the flag cannot be false
	//         then.

/**
 * packages/p2p-probe-host/relay-multi-peer-smoke.mjs — Phase-41 Wave-0 Node-only D-02 gate.
 *
 * De-risks the whole multi-peer-relay-close phase BEFORE any costly emulator run. Extends
 * `two-drone-smoke.mjs`'s topology skeleton (multi-node array, sequential start, bounded
 * poll, explicit exit code, SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown) and `relay-smoke.mjs`'s relay-client
 * config + reservation-poll into a single harness that boots 2 relay-drones + 2 relay-client
 * peers and directly reproduces the carried P2P-11 "wall #8" (the per-drone relay-reservation
 * asymmetry) on Node, then proves the relay-qualified-addr fix closes it — in seconds, not a
 * 30+ minute device run.
 *
 * Mechanism under test (read directly from the installed @libp2p/circuit-relay-v2@4.2.5
 * dist source, then EXERCISED live on this exact installed graph — findings feed 41-02):
 *   - A bare `/p2p-circuit` listenAddr entry reserves relay capacity via the 'discovered'
 *     reservation type, capped at ONE reservation per listen-addr entry — the second relay
 *     discovered after the first completes hits HadEnoughRelaysError and is silently
 *     rejected. This is the wall-#8 mechanism, and it reproduces exactly on Node.
 *   - A relay-qualified listenAddr entry (`${relayAddr}/p2p-circuit`, one per known relay)
 *     takes the 'configured' reservation path (listener.js CircuitListen.exactMatch →
 *     openConnection(relayAddr) + reservationStore.addRelay(peerId, 'configured')), which
 *     is EXEMPT from the one-slot cap.
 *   - CRITICAL EXERCISED FINDING (not in the static research; discovered by running this
 *     gate — 41-02 must apply BOTH parts of the fix): N relay-qualified entries alone do
 *     NOT yield N reservations under the DEFAULT `circuitRelayTransport()`. The reservation
 *     queue runs at DEFAULT_RESERVATION_CONCURRENCY = 1, so the first 'configured'
 *     reservation completes and calls #checkReservationCount(), which — because no bare
 *     `/p2p-circuit` seed left any 'discovered' slot pending (pendingReservations.length===0)
 *     — treats that as "have enough relays" and calls reserveQueue.clear(), DROPPING the
 *     still-queued second reservation (and, because listen() awaits it, hanging start()).
 *     The fix is to raise reservation concurrency so both 'configured' reservations are
 *     in-flight before either clears the queue: `circuitRelayTransport({ reservationConcurrency: N })`.
 *
 * Topology, all in-process:
 *   drone-A (profile:'storage', bounded relayServerInit) — first bootstrap peer, no upstream.
 *   drone-B (profile:'storage', bounded relayServerInit) — cross-bootstrapped to drone-A's
 *     control AND strand multiaddrs (mirrors two-drone-smoke.mjs). Both drone STRAND nodes
 *     also derive enableRelay from profile:'storage', so each is a circuit-relay server.
 *   client-A / client-B (profile:'transaction', CadreNodeProvider.tsx-shaped) — run in TWO
 *     modes, selected by LISTEN_MODE (default: run BOTH sequentially). In BOTH modes the
 *     relay TARGET is the drones' STRAND-node addresses (a separate libp2p instance/port
 *     from their control addresses, per RESEARCH.md Pitfall 2):
 *       BARE      — controlNetwork.bootstrapNodes = [droneA-control, droneB-control] (needed
 *                   so relay discovery LEARNS of both drones as candidate relays, and so the
 *                   client's own control-DB founds cleanly). network.listenAddrs =
 *                   ['/p2p-circuit'], transports use the DEFAULT `circuitRelayTransport()`
 *                   (verbatim mirror of the CURRENT app). start() succeeds; the discovered
 *                   reservation forms post-start and the one-slot cap holds — expect exactly
 *                   ONE distinct relay peer reserved per client (reproduces wall #8).
 *       QUALIFIED — controlNetwork.bootstrapNodes = [] (SOLO — the client is told NOTHING
 *                   about any drone; this settles Assumption A1 in the strongest possible
 *                   form: the 'configured' path cold-dials both drone STRAND nodes purely
 *                   from the listenAddrs). network.listenAddrs = [`${droneAStrand}/p2p-circuit`,
 *                   `${droneBStrand}/p2p-circuit`] with `circuitRelayTransport({ reservationConcurrency: 2 })`
 *                   (the fix). Expect TWO distinct relay peers reserved per client (both drones).
 *
 * NOTE on the QUALIFIED observation (an in-process-harness artifact, NOT a device concern):
 *   A 'transaction' client that founds its OWN control-DB in the SAME start() as it takes
 *   relay reservations cannot complete the founding CadreControl DDL — the relayed
 *   self-addresses the configured reservations publish break the control cohort's own
 *   consensus delivery, so start() ultimately rejects. This does NOT affect the reservation
 *   result (the reservations form ~20ms into start, well before the DDL step), so QUALIFIED
 *   mode OBSERVES the reservation count via a poller that reads getControlNode().getMultiaddrs()
 *   while start() runs, tolerating the known founding-DDL rejection. On device this artifact
 *   does not arise: the app's control-DB is already founded from an earlier session, so a
 *   relaunch's relay reservations never race a founding DDL.
 *
 * After the reservation gate, Task 2's four source-level open probes (Open Q1 per-node-type
 * network override, native autoDial vs the retired 38-14 retry-dial, the n=4/needed=3 quorum
 * formula, and the @libp2p/interface single-copy count) are printed as labeled, source-cited
 * log lines — diagnostic reads + assertions only, no product/vendored code is touched.
 *
 * Phase-41-04 addition — STRAND-COHORT SMOKE (D-02, drives REAL strand-cohort formation, not
 * just relay reservation): after the reservation modes above, a fresh 2-drone + 2-relay-client
 * topology is booted where both clients are CONTROL-bootstrapped to both drones (so
 * `resolveCohortSeed`'s strand-addr RPC — see below — has live control connections to query)
 * AND carry the D-05 relay-qualified `network.listenAddrs`/`reservationConcurrency` posture
 * (the exact shape `replication-proof-runner.ts`/`CadreNodeProvider.tsx` ship). Each client then
 * calls `addStrand()` on the SAME strand the drones host and polls
 * `getStrand(STRAND_ID)?.libp2pNode?.getConnections()?.length` (the runner's exact
 * `readStrandPeers` accessor) until `strandPeers>0` or a bounded timeout.
 *
 * SOURCE-READ FINDING (not in the 41-01/41-02 static research — read directly from the
 * INSTALLED `@serfab/cadre-core@0.8.1` dist this session): the `network.strandBootstrapNodes`
 * field VT's app config still sets is DEAD on this substrate. `NetworkConfig`
 * (`dist/types.d.ts:107-172`) has NO `strandBootstrapNodes` field at all (retired), and
 * `StrandInstanceManager.buildStrandRuntime` (`dist/strand-instance-manager.js:165`) sources its
 * `createLibp2pNode({ bootstrapNodes, ... })` call from `config.bootstrapNodes` — which
 * `CadreNode.launchStrand` (`dist/cadre-node.js:1909-1928`) populates from
 * `resolveCohortSeed(strandId)` (`:1943-1957`), NOT from any caller-supplied strand-bootstrap
 * list. `resolveCohortSeed` queries the CONTROL network's already-connected `CadrePeer` siblings
 * and RPCs each one over the control mesh via `collectStrandAddrs`/`STRAND_ADDR_PROTOCOL`
 * (`dist/strand-addr-protocol.js`, protocol id `/sereus/strand-addr/1.0.0`) asking "what are your
 * live strand-`X` multiaddrs?" — the responder answers with
 * `orderSignalingFirst(node.getMultiaddrs())` (`cadre-node.js:1961-1972`, relay/`p2p-circuit`
 * addrs ordered first). This REPLACES the old static-address strand-bootstrap model entirely; a
 * strand joiner needs ONLY a live CONTROL connection to a sibling that already runs the strand —
 * no manual strand-address wiring is read by cadre-core at all on this substrate.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   cd packages/p2p-probe-host
 *   node relay-multi-peer-smoke.mjs                  # runs BOTH modes (default)
 *   LISTEN_MODE=bare node relay-multi-peer-smoke.mjs      # bare mode only
 *   LISTEN_MODE=qualified node relay-multi-peer-smoke.mjs # qualified mode only
 *   LISTEN_MODE=none node relay-multi-peer-smoke.mjs      # skip both reservation modes (isolates the strand-cohort gate)
 *   STRAND_COHORT_SMOKE=skip node relay-multi-peer-smoke.mjs # skip the strand-cohort gate
 *
 * Exit 0 + "MULTI-PEER RELAY SMOKE: PASS" when (bare-mode clients reserve with exactly 1
 * drone each) AND (qualified-mode clients reserve with 2 drones each); exit 1 +
 * "MULTI-PEER RELAY SMOKE: FAIL <reason>" otherwise — a FAIL here is a precise pre-device
 * blocker, not a signal to proceed to the emulator run. The STRAND-COHORT SMOKE verdict is
 * printed ADDITIONALLY and does NOT change the process exit code (D-02: a Node FAIL there is
 * only decisive once the diagnosis doc below adjudicates whether the wall is Node-reproducible
 * or an emulator-NAT-only surface — see 41-04-STRAND-COHORT-DIAGNOSIS.md).

// ROUTING across the emulator NAT (relayAddrsPerDrone=0, NoValidAddressesError 56x,
// UnsupportedProtocolError 52x) despite the CONTROL network forming fine (relayReservation=true,
// peers=3). This probe answers the plan's Task 1 questions with TWO Node-provable checks, using
// the SAME D-02 workaround as REGISTRAR-SKEW SMOKE (createLibp2pNode directly, no CadreNode
// wrapper, no control-layer founding cold-start):
//
//   CHECK 1 (config-divergence, REQUIRED by the plan's must-haves): builds ONE relay + ONE
//   strand-config node (networkName `strand-<id>`, fretProfile 'edge') carrying the exact
//   app-shaped relay-qualified listenAddrs posture (`${relayAddr}/p2p-circuit`, mirrors
//   `STRAND_RELAY_LISTEN_ADDRS` in replication-proof-runner.ts:99-102 /
//   CadreNodeProvider.tsx:95), then polls getMultiaddrs()/addresses.listen for the resulting
//   `/p2p-circuit` entry. This proves whether a strand-config node that IS given relay-qualified
//   listenAddrs actually advertises them — the config-divergence half the plan's D-02 caveat says
//   Node CAN prove (contrast an UNqualified strand node, which reserves nothing).
//
//   CHECK 2 (NET-NEW this session, NOT anticipated by the plan/RESEARCH — decisive,
//   Node-reproduced): reproduces the mechanism this diagnosis actually found by reading
//   cadre-node.js + the installed @libp2p/circuit-relay-v2 server dist: `CadreNode`'s CONTROL
//   node and every per-strand libp2p node instance SHARE THE SAME PeerId (confirmed source
//   comment, strand-addr-protocol.js:4-10 "even though both share the same peerId") AND share
//   ONE `network.transports`/`network.listenAddrs` object verbatim (cadre-node.js:171
//   `this.config = config`; cadre-node.js:497-499 forwards it to the control node's OWN
//   createLibp2pNode call; cadre-node.js:1916 `network: this.config.network` forwards the
//   IDENTICAL object into `launchStrand`/`strandManager.startStrand`; strand-instance-manager.js
//   :179-180 conditionally forwards `config.network.transports`/`config.network.listenAddrs`
//   into the strand's OWN `createLibp2pNode` call) — so BOTH nodes independently reserve a
//   `/p2p-circuit` slot at the SAME relay (the drone) using the SAME PeerId. The relay SERVER's
//   `@libp2p/circuit-relay-v2` `ReservationStore` (server/reservation-store.js:20 `trackedPeerMap`,
//   :25-27 `reserve(peer, addr, limit)` keyed SOLELY by `peer`) and its HOP-CONNECT delivery path
//   (server/index.js:230 `connectionManager.getConnections(dstPeer)`, :236
//   `const destinationConnection = connections[0]`) cannot distinguish the control node's
//   connection from the strand node's connection — both present the SAME `dstPeer`. This check
//   builds TWO edge nodes sharing ONE generated Ed25519 keypair (mirrors the app's shared
//   identity), both reserving through the SAME relay under DIFFERENT `networkName`s
//   (`control-mimic` / `strand-mimic`, so each registers its OWN, DISTINCT FRET protocol
//   strings), then dials a THIRD sibling node's stream THROUGH the shared PeerId's relay circuit
//   address, requesting the `strand-mimic`-only FRET ping protocol. A byte-perfect reproduction
//   of the 41-09 device signal (`UnsupportedProtocolError: Protocol selection failed - could not
//   negotiate /optimystic/strand-mimic/fret/1.0.0/ping`) CONFIRMS the hop-connect delivered the
//   relayed stream to the WRONG (control-mimic) connection — verified directly by ALSO dialing
//   the `control-mimic`-only protocol via the exact same circuit address and observing it
//   SUCCEED. Non-gating (mirrors REGISTRAR-SKEW SMOKE's own posture) — prints its own verdict

// Proves the 41-11 fix (the additive cadre-core `strandNetwork` override, authored as a
// yarn-patch this session) on Node/loopback — the inverse of the SHARED-IDENTITY sub-check
// above. The collision the sub-check reproduces exists because the control node and the strand
// node share ONE PeerId AND reserve at the SAME relay, so the relay server's hop-connect
// (server/index.js:230-236 connections[0], keyed solely by PeerId) can deliver a sibling's
// strand-directed stream to the control connection. The fix gives the strand node a DISTINCT
// relay target from the control node's (app-side: `network` → drone CONTROL relay,
// `strandNetwork` → drone STRAND relay; 41-10 diagnosis §5). Modeled here at the
// `createLibp2pNode` level (the same D-02 workaround the sub-check uses): control-mimic reserves
// at relay-CONTROL, strand-mimic reserves at relay-STRAND — DIFFERENT relay servers, still ONE
// shared PeerId. Because relay-STRAND holds ONLY the strand-mimic connection for that PeerId,
// a sibling dialing strand-mimic's OWN /p2p-circuit addr negotiates strand-mimic's OWN protocol:
// the collision is GONE. Deterministic (no connections[0] ordering race — each relay has exactly
// one connection per PeerId). Non-gating (mirrors the other STRAND-RELAY-ROUTING probes) —
// prints its own verdict line and does not affect MULTI-PEER RELAY SMOKE's exit code.

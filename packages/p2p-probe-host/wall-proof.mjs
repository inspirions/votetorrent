/**
 * packages/p2p-probe-host/wall-proof.mjs — the D-07 wall proof (Phase 56 Plan 01).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. 56-04 (Wave 2) patches the strand-mesh gap
 * (`strand-addr-protocol.js:179` in `@serfab/cadre-core`, not optimystic, not P2P-11) that lets an
 * unauthorized peer reach the public election view. Before that patch is SCOPED, this harness
 * proves what the wall currently does — against a gateway whose every unconditional-admit branch
 * is verified CLOSED, so the result cannot be the cold-start `authorized.length === 0` carve-out
 * masquerading as a real refusal (`feedback_read_back_preconditions_dont_infer`).
 *
 * NODE-SIDE ONLY. This is a `@serfab/cadre-core` + `@optimystic/db-p2p` integration harness, not a
 * device proof — it runs the REAL admission internals in-process against a REAL outsider libp2p
 * node built from the same factory (`createLibp2pNode` from `@optimystic/db-p2p/rn`) the browser
 * Edge node (56-05) will use.
 *
 * RUNGS (each ends in a definite classified verdict — an unclassified timeout or "could not tell"
 * exits 1, because a wall proof that shrugs is worse than no proof):
 *   RUNG_P     — precondition control: every unconditional-admit branch is verified closed by
 *                direct reads that THROW (never skip) on a missing member. An assertion, not a
 *                measurement — see `assessPrecondition`.
 *   RUNG_L1    — Layer 1, protocol-blind connection admission. (Task 2)
 *   RUNG_L2    — Layer 2, `authorizeInboundControlStream`, behavioural + source-scan. (Task 2)
 *   RUNG_L3    — Layer 3, the strand-addr protocol handler's own `isMember`. (Task 2)
 *   RUNG_POS   — positive control: an authorized peer succeeds on the same probe code path, so
 *                every refusal above is attributable to the gate, not to a broken probe. (Task 2)
 *   RUNG_RELAY — the gateway's relay posture, decided on measured behaviour. (Task 2)
 *   RUNG_F4    — CONTEXT Finding 4: can a peer already holding valid strand addresses complete a
 *                strand-mesh read? (Task 3)
 *
 * CLI:
 *   --preconditions-only   boot a SEEDED gateway, run RUNG_P only, then shut down.
 *   --self-test            RUNG_P's inversion: boot an UNSEEDED gateway and require RUNG_P to FAIL
 *                           and `admitInboundControlConnection` to return 'admit' — proves the
 *                           precondition rung CAN fail (a rung that cannot fail is not a control).
 *   --relay=on|off          force the RUNG_RELAY posture under test (default: measure both).
 *   --json <path>           where to write the machine-readable record (default: ./wall-proof-record.json).
 *   (no flags)              the full sequence: RUNG_P, RUNG_L1..RUNG_RELAY, RUNG_F4, record emission.
 *
 * Exit: 0 on a fully classified PASS run, 1 on any unclassified/failed rung. SIGINT/SIGTERM stop
 * every node this process started (enrolment-smoke.mjs's shape).
 *
 * NOTE for whoever runs this: CadreNode boot is CPU-heavy and a busy host has previously
 * manufactured false failures (`project_voter_emulator_boot_needs_quiet_host`) — do not run this
 * concurrently with `nx run-many`.

 * `createInvite`. `createInvite` opens a 30-minute enrollment window as a side effect
 * (`DEFAULT_ENROLLMENT_WINDOW_MS`, `membership-connection-gater.js:174`), and `openEnrollmentWindow`
 * is monotonic (`cadre-node.js:1203`, `Math.max` — can never be narrowed once opened), so calling it
 * even once would admit every stranger unconditionally for the rest of this process's life and
 * defeat every rung this plan exists to run. `seed-bootstrap.js:964-979` shows `acceptPhone({
 * phonePeerId })` with NO `issuedInvite` argument writes the `CadrePeer` voucher directly via
 * `authorizePeer` and never touches the enrollment window — that is the seeding path used here.

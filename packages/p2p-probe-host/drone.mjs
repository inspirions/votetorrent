/**
 * packages/p2p-probe-host/drone.mjs — Phase 17 P2P-01 dial-proof host drone.
 *
 * Committed, repeatable dev tooling (Phase 22 reuse).  Ported from spike 009.
 *
 * A storage-profile CadreNode that listens on an ephemeral WebSocket address so
 * the Android emulator can dial it (emulator reaches the host at 10.0.2.2).
 * Boots, prints the control peerId + ws multiaddr, then stays alive.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   This package is a normal yarn workspace — `yarn install` at the repo root installs its deps.
 *   The root `resolutions` pin uint8arrays only for ^5 ranges (Hermes/quereus compat), so
 *   @multiformats/multiaddr's ^6 requirement resolves to a real v6 and strict Node ESM works.
 *   The connectionGater-pass-through patch this comment used to name was RETIRED at `ca9f1b87`.
 *   `.yarn/patches/` now carries the gossipsub and quereus patches plus the Phase 56
 *   `@serfab-cadre-core-npm-0.12.0-*` public-observer patch, which DOES resolve here (same
 *   workspace, same `@serfab/cadre-core` dependency) but is INERT on this drone: it only takes
 *   effect on a `CadreNode` configured with a non-empty `publicObserverStrandIds`, and this
 *   drone sets none — D-03's outer fail-closed layer, observed in the wild. This drone is NOT
 *   the public gateway; that is `packages/p2p-probe-host/gateway.mjs`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   cd packages/p2p-probe-host
 *   nvm use 22
 *   node drone.mjs
 *
 *   Copy the printed ws multiaddr + peerId into CONTROL_ADDR in dial-probe.ts,
 *   then run ./scripts/run-dial-probe.sh.
 *
 * Exit: Ctrl-C (SIGINT) or `kill <pid>` (SIGTERM) — both gracefully stop the node.

//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (P2P-11 root cause, 2026-08-24, re-confirmed 2026-09-03). Every device
// n=4 run through 38-21/41-09 failed with the strand cohort never forming. The cause is not
// addressing, relays or db-p2p: the devices are simply NOT MEMBERS. drone-A refuses their
// strand-addr requests with
//     sereus:cadre:strand-addr Refusing strand-addr from non-member <device control peerId>
// because `isAuthorizedMember` needs a CadrePeer row carrying an anchored voucher, and this
// harness never ran a ceremony that creates one. Devices were addressable but unauthorized,
// so their strand nodes received no cohort addresses and replication could never start.
//
// cadre-core deliberately never runs owner genesis implicitly — the hosting app owns it — so
// a harness must do it explicitly or every owner-signed control write (createCadreInvitation
// included) fails. This mirrors tools/multipeer-gate, which is the green n=4 reference for this
// ceremony; keep the two in step.
//
// cadre-core 1.14 replaced the two-sided invite ceremony (owner `createInvite`, joiner
// `trustOwnerKeys` + `dialInvite`, owner `acceptPhone`) with ONE-SIDED redemption: the owner
// mints a cadre invitation (`createCadreInvitation`), and the joiner redeems it at any member it
// can reach (`redeemCadreInvitation`). The member that answers seats the joiner's `CadrePeer`
// row itself, during the redemption — no owner-side accept, no peerId crossing a process
// boundary, no enrollment window (1.14 deleted it: a stranger's connection is now admitted
// provisionally and the per-stream protocol guard is the boundary). So the founder mints ONE
// multi-use invitation, the harness injects it into the phones and drone-B, and each redeems.
//
// The pre-1.14 auto-accept loop (`watchForJoiners`: authorize every connected non-member) is
// kept only as an OPT-IN fallback (DRONE_AUTO_ACCEPT=1), ported to `authorizePeer`. It is off by
// default because redemption already authorizes every joiner, and because under 1.14 every
// stranger holds a connection here for a while, so "connected" no longer implies "invited".
// DRONE_ENROL_DIR stays as an explicit out-of-band path (drop a file named for a peerId).

  // with no such provenance -- so the derivation says "joiner" even here. Under cadre-core
  // >= 1.1.0's first-sync gate that is a deadlock, not a slow start: a joiner is withheld its
  // database until some member's Header reaches it, and with nobody founding, no Header ever
  // exists. Every node then reports "no member of this strand has been reachable since this
  // machine joined" and every write fails with "no active strand database" -- which reads exactly
  // like a peer-reachability failure. An explicit value wins over the derivation. Left undefined
  // on a joiner drone, so its gating is the real thing.
  // founder:true only when this drone founds the strand. With no STRAND_ID set, an unset
  // DRONE_STRAND_ROLE keeps the inferred options (control founder -> founder:true, joiner drone ->
  // no founder key). With an explicit STRAND_ID, resolveStrandRole refuses to start unless

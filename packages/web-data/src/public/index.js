/**
 * public/index.js — the anonymous-reader barrel of `@votetorrent/web-data`.
 *
 * Serves `apps/VoteTorrentPublic`, an unauthenticated visitor with no officer
 * identity. This barrel must NEVER re-export anything under `src/officer/`
 * (D-04) — that boundary is what makes the `./public` / `./officer` subpath
 * split structural rather than decorative.
 *
 * The connection layer (`open-db.js`, `reattach.js`, `networks-registry.js`)
 * landed here in this plan's Task 2 — explicit named re-exports only, never
 * `export *`, so the surface of this audience is readable at a glance and
 * 54-08's scan has a literal list to reason about. It is audience-neutral: it
 * opens a database and selects no application table.
 *
 * The public read modules landed in 54-06: `read-election.js` (header,
 * founding revision, election list), `read-registrant-roll.js` (D-18/D-19's
 * three-column voter roll) and `read-keyrelease.js` (D-14's counts-only
 * aggregate). Each module's raw SQL constants are deliberately NOT re-exported
 * here — they exist for that module's own import-time guards and for 54-08's
 * scan, which imports the modules by path. Each module's `TABLES_READ` IS
 * re-exported, under a module-qualified name, because three modules cannot all
 * re-export a binding of that name from one barrel without colliding — the
 * same convention `officer/index.js` adopted in 54-03b.

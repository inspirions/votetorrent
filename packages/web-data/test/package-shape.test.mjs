/**
 * package-shape.test.mjs — the tier-1 proof that `@votetorrent/web-data`'s
 * shape properties are falsifiable, not merely asserted. Modelled rung-for-
 * rung on `packages/ui-web/test/package-shape.test.mjs` — see that file's
 * header for the two forbidden vacuous shapes this file also avoids:
 *   - Do not interpolate a value under test into a test's NAME.
 *   - Do not use an always-true disjunct in an assertion's condition.
 *
 * What each rung catches:
 *   1. The exports map has exactly two keys, `./public` and `./officer`,
 *      mapping to their expected targets.
 *   2. The map has NO `"."` key — the D-04 structural claim. Proven with
 *      `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, plus a positive control that the
 *      same check fires against a synthetic manifest object that DOES have
 *      one (so this rung cannot be vacuously true).
 *   3. Both subpath targets resolve to files that exist on disk.
 *   4. `@votetorrent/web-data/public` is Node-importable with no bundler.
 *   5. The three peer-declared packages (`@quereus/quereus`,
 *      `@quereus/plugin-indexeddb`, `@votetorrent/vote-engine`) appear in
 *      BOTH `peerDependencies` and `devDependencies` — the ui-web TS2875
 *      guard, one instance more, with one measured exception: `yarn install`
 *      REJECTS a `patch:` resolution-protocol descriptor in `peerDependencies`
 *      (a peer range must be a plain semver range, not a resolution
 *      descriptor — confirmed live: `yarn install` rewrote an attempted
 *      literal-copy peer entry to `"*"`, silently discarding the version
 *      guard). So `@quereus/quereus`'s peer entry is the plain version the
 *      patch is based on (`4.17.1`), asserted as a substring of the patched
 *      devDependencies descriptor rather than a literal-string match; the
 *      other two peers, which carry no patch protocol, ARE asserted by exact
 *      string equality.
 *   6. `@votetorrent/ui-web` appears in none of this package's dependency
 *      blocks — this package has no UI charter and must not acquire the
 *      dedupe/gate-script obligation `scripts/assert-ui-web-dedupe-and-gate.mjs`
 *      imposes on ui-web consumers.

/**
 * anonymity-scan.test.mjs — D-05's gate: no table an anonymous reader may not
 * see is referenced, as CODE, anywhere in the public entry's WHOLE import
 * closure.
 *
 * WHAT IT ROOTS OVER, AND WHY EACH ROOT IS WHAT IT IS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scanned:
 *   - `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/src` — the no-login app's whole source tree.
 *   - `packages/web-data/src` — the WHOLE package, not just `src/public`. This
 *     widened (54-20 / I-56) after the verifier found `open-db.js`,
 *     `reattach.js` and `networks-registry.js` sitting one directory ABOVE
 *     `src/public/` while still being loaded by the public entry: a forbidden
 *     table added to any of the three was invisible to this gate. A whole-tree
 *     root with explicit exclusions is what keeps the NEXT top-level module in
 *     scope by default — a hand-listed set of "the three files we found" would
 *     put the next one back outside the gate with nobody noticing. Control 6c
 *     below plants a forbidden-table statement into a temp copy of
 *     `reattach.js` and requires it be reported, so this widening's green is
 *     attributable to the connection layer being clean rather than to it
 *     still being unread.
 *
 * Deliberately OUTSIDE the root, each an exclusion rather than an oversight:
 *
 *   - `packages/web-data/src/classification.js`. It IS the table list; it holds
 *     every forbidden name as an object key. Widening the root over it would
 *     make this checker permanently green — the self-tripping-checker failure
 *     mode this repo has now recorded six times. Control 6 below copies that
 *     file into a temp scan root and asserts the scan DOES report it, so the
 *     real run's green is attributable to the root choice and not to a blind
 *     matcher. Do not widen the root; the control exists to make that
 *     conversation happen against evidence.
 *
 *   - `packages/web-data/src/officer/**`. The officer surface is SUPPOSED to
 *     read officer-only tables. What keeps it off an anonymous page is D-04's
 *     subpath split, asserted in `audience-boundary.test.mjs`, not this scan.
 *     Control 6b below proves this exclusion is load-bearing the same way
 *     control 6 does for `classification.js`: copy `officer/registrations.js`
 *     (the officer module that references forbidden-class tables as code —
 *     `officer/read-keyholders.js` was rejected as the fixture because its
 *     officer-only-ness is a JOIN PATTERN over two public-safe tables and it
 *     names no forbidden table at all, which would make this control pass
 *     vacuously) into a clean temp root and assert the scan DOES report it.
 *
 *   - `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/test/**`. Fixtures legitimately seed rows and
 *     never ship. The tables 54-16 will seed are public-safe after D-18/D-15,
 *     so this exclusion is not load-bearing today; it is recorded so that if a
 *     fixture ever needs a forbidden table, extending the exclusion is a known
 *     decision rather than a discovery.
 *
 * Both `packages/web-data` exclusions are entries in `SCAN_EXCLUSIONS`, applied
 * via `scannedFilesFor`/`scanForNames` (`./lib/source-scan.mjs`). An exclusion
 * entry that stops matching anything (a rename, a move) throws
 * `StaleExclusionError` rather than silently rotting into a permanent hole —
 * see the stale-exclusion and separator-boundary cases below control 6c.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT PROVE (carried here from 54-VALIDATION so the limit
 * lives with the code):
 *   - It proves no forbidden table is REFERENCED in the public entry's file
 *     set. It does not prove the rendered page is anonymous.
 *   - A leak through a module reached at runtime by a COMPUTED dynamic
 *     specifier is invisible to it. (`audience-boundary.test.mjs` treats a
 *     computed specifier as a failure to analyse for exactly this reason.)
 *   - A leak through data already in memory — a value read by an allowed query
 *     and rendered — names no table anywhere and is out of reach.
 *   - Nothing about what the page DISPLAYS. That is 54-16's browser tier.
 * Two structural facts do more work than this scan does, and it is the
 * BACKSTOP, not the primary control: D-04's subpath split makes the officer
 * read layer unreachable by construction, and 54-06's import-time
 * `assertPublicSafe` / `assertNoIdentifyingColumns` make a widened public query
 * a load-time crash.
 *
 * RULE 1 OF THIS PLAN'S SCAN DESIGN, enforced by the self-trip guard at the
 * bottom: the forbidden name set is DERIVED at runtime from `CLASSIFICATION` ×
 * `FORBIDDEN_CLASSES`. The only hand-written table-name literals in this file
 * live between the two sentinel comments, and the guard asserts the rest of the
 * file — prose included — contains none of them.

 * `SCAN_EXCLUSIONS` removes `officer/` (5 files) and `classification.js` (1).

 *
 * MOVED FROM 22 TO 26 in `56-09`, deliberately, for a named reason: four new
 * files landed under `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/src/peer/`, inside this scan's
 * public-app root, none of them a reclassification of an existing table —
 * `identity.js` and `edge-node.js` (`56-05`), `config.js` (`56-06`) and
 * `reactivity-bridge.js` (`56-09` itself). All four were verified to pass
 * the SUBSTANCE of this file's D-05 scan (test 16 below, over the widened
 * 26-file set) before this count was bumped — a passing count bump here is
 * never sufficient on its own; the content check must already be green.
 *
 * MOVED FROM 26 TO 28 after Wave 4, deliberately, same reason and same
 * evidence standard. TWO new files landed inside the public-app scan root,
 * neither a reclassification of an existing table:
 *   - `src/peer/strand-read.js` (`56-16`), a fifth connection-layer module;
 *   - `src/screens/PublicApp.tsx` (`56-12`), a new production composition.
 * The SUBSTANCE check (test 16 below, `D-05: zero forbidden-class table names
 * as code`) was already GREEN over the widened 28-file set at the moment this
 * count moved — control 6e was the sole failing assertion (140 tests, 139
 * pass). A passing count bump is never sufficient on its own; the content
 * check must already be green.
 *
 * The measured value was read back from the gate's own failure message rather
 * than derived by counting new modules by hand: an initial bump to 27 was
 * wrong because it reasoned only about `peer/` and missed `screens/`.
 *
 * NOTE FOR THE NEXT PLAN THAT ADDS A FILE UNDER `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/src/`:
 * this pin is structurally coupled to that WHOLE root, not just `peer/`, and no
 * single plan's isolated test run can see the drift — only a full
 * `@votetorrent/web-data` run does. Re-pin it in the SAME commit that adds the
 * file, verify the substance check first, and read the new number off this
 * gate's failure message instead of inferring it.
 *
 * 56-11 moved this 28 -> 29: it adds exactly one new file under the scanned
 * root, `apps/VoteTorrentPublic/src/peer/boot.js` (the production peer-layer
 * composition wired into `main.tsx`). Before re-pinning, test 16 ("D-05: zero

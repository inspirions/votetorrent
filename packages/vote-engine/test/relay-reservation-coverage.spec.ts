/**
 * relay-reservation-coverage.spec.ts
 *
 * P2P-11 gap-closure regression lock, updated in lockstep with the 41-02 D-05
 * relay-qualified-listenAddrs fix (per 41-01's Node gate + probe findings).
 *
 * History: 38-20 closed the prior wall by arming `replication-proof-runner.ts`
 * with the bare sentinel `listenAddrs: ['/p2p-circuit']` (matching
 * `CadreNodeProvider.tsx`'s D-03 posture at the time). The on-device 38-21 run
 * then hit an EIGHTH wall: the bare sentinel drives `@libp2p/circuit-relay-v2`'s
 * one-slot `'discovered'` reservation cap, so an emulator peer reachable from
 * TWO drones ends up reserved with only ONE of them (asymmetric
 * `NoValidAddressesError`). The 41-01 Node gate reproduced this exactly (bare
 * mode = 1 relay peer) and proved the fix (qualified mode = 2 relay peers):
 * replace the bare sentinel with ONE relay-qualified `${addr}/p2p-circuit`
 * listenAddrs entry PER KNOWN DRONE (RESEARCH Pattern 1, `'configured'`
 * reservation path, no one-slot cap), paired with
 * `circuitRelayTransport({ reservationConcurrency: <droneCount> })` (Probe 5 —
 * the default concurrency of 1 silently drops any 2nd+ reservation), plus the
 * `transportSymbol` cast (D-10 — `as unknown as ReturnType<typeof webSockets>`)
 * for multi-copy `@libp2p/interface` brand-skew safety.
 *
 * Both `apps/` construction sites move in lockstep (Probe 1, 41-01: cadre-core
 * forwards ONE shared `network` object to the control node AND every strand,
 * so there is no per-node-type override to diverge) — this spec's "parity
 * anchor" therefore checks that BOTH files carry the SAME set of structural
 * markers (qualified-addr construction, dynamic reservationConcurrency,
 * transportSymbol cast, no bare/empty listenAddrs literal), not byte-identical
 * text — `replication-proof-runner.ts` alone carries the second `_B` drone
 * constant (the n=4 on-device harness drives 2 drones; `CadreNodeProvider.tsx`
 * is the production single-authority app and only ever needs 1).
 *
 * Assertions are anchored to the `network: { ... hibernation: }` config-body
 * slice (extract-between-markers, mirrors relay-reachability-coverage.spec.ts's
 * extractConnectBody) for the listenAddrs-assignment/cast checks, and to the
 * whole (comment-stripped) file for the qualified-addr template-literal
 * construction (which is declared as a top-level constant ABOVE the network
 * body, then referenced by identifier inside it). Comment-stripping follows
 * the 38-18 deviation lesson: a fix's own explanatory comment must not
 * false-satisfy a marker check. All markers are built by string concatenation
 * so this spec's own prose cannot self-satisfy an assertion. Static
 * source-text guard only — the on-device both-emulator re-proof is 41-03's
 * scope.

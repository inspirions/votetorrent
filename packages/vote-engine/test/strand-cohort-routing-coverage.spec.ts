/**
 * strand-cohort-routing-coverage.spec.ts
 *
 * P2P-11 gap-closure regression lock for 41-04's strand-cohort-formation fix on the published
 * `@serfab/cadre-core@0.8.1` / `@optimystic/db-p2p@0.14.1` substrate.
 *
 * History: 41-03 hit a NEW dominant wall on the published substrate — `strandPeers=0` on Peer A,
 * with the drone D-08 histogram dominated by `NoValidAddressesError: no valid addresses for peer`
 * (132x). 41-04's diagnosis (41-04-STRAND-COHORT-DIAGNOSIS.md) found the app's D-05 relay-qualified
 * addressing posture (`STRAND_RELAY_LISTEN_ADDRS` in both `replication-proof-runner.ts` and
 * `CadreNodeProvider.tsx`) was ALREADY correct since 41-02 — this spec's job is to confirm that
 * posture has NOT regressed (parity anchor, reusing `relay-reservation-coverage.spec.ts`'s
 * extraction/comment-strip/concatenation-marker patterns verbatim), not to lock a NEW app-file
 * shape. The actual fix landed one layer below app config: `@optimystic/db-p2p@0.14.1`'s
 * `createLibp2pNodeBase` registers `identify()` but never its companion `identifyPush()` service,
 * so a relay-only peer's address gained AFTER an existing connection is established never
 * propagates to an already-connected sibling's peerStore — the exact mechanism behind the
 * dominant `NoValidAddressesError` signal. The fix is a `.yarn/patches/@optimystic-db-p2p-*`
 * yarn-patch adding `identifyPush` to that services map, resolved via a root `package.json`
 * `resolutions` entry. This spec locks BOTH halves: the unchanged app-side addressing posture
 * (parity across the two libp2p-node-construction sites, Probe 1: no per-node-type override
 * exists) AND the yarn-patch's presence/content/resolution-wiring (a silent revert of either
 * would reopen the 41-03 wall without any other signal changing).
 *
 * Does NOT resurrect any of the 8 `describe.skip`'d Phase-38 vendor-path specs (Pitfall 3 — they
 * `readFileSync` a `vendor/` path Phase 40 deleted). All markers are built by string concatenation
 * so this spec's own prose can never self-satisfy an assertion it defines.
 *
 * 41-06 EXTENSION: the device n=4 re-prove (41-05) with the identifyPush patch live shifted the
 * dominant wall to the p2p-fret strand-discovery protocol layer — FRET `UnsupportedProtocolError`
 * jumped ~6x -> 77x, plus a malformed `//optimystic/strand-<id>/id/1.0.0` double-slash (6x).
 * 41-06's diagnosis (41-06-FRET-NEGOTIATION-DIAGNOSIS.md) root-caused the double-slash to
 * `@optimystic/db-p2p` passing an already-slash-prefixed `protocolPrefix` into `@libp2p/identify`
 * (which itself prepends another leading slash), and found a real async-completeness gap in
 * `p2p-fret`: `registerRpcHandlers()` never awaited its four fire-and-forget `node.handle(...)`
 * registrations, so the Startable `start()` chain could resolve before the FRET handlers'
 * `peerStore` advertisement had actually settled. The fix is TWO yarn-patches: the existing
 * `@optimystic/db-p2p` patch EXTENDED with the single-slash `protocolPrefix` correction
 * (identifyPush kept, unchanged in behavior), and a NEW sibling `p2p-fret` patch making
 * `registerPing`/`registerNeighbors`/`registerMaybeAct`/`registerLeave` return their
 * `node.handle()` promise and `FretService.start()` await `registerRpcHandlers()`. This extension
 * locks BOTH new hunks + BOTH resolution entries — a silent revert of either must fail this spec.
 *
 * 41-08 EXTENSION: the device n=4 re-prove (41-07) with the 41-06 fixes live left the wall
 * PARTIALLY closed — the malformed `//id` double-slash was confirmed gone (6x -> 0x) but the
 * well-formed FRET `fret/1.0.0/{ping,neighbors}` handlers were STILL not negotiable
 * (`UnsupportedProtocolError` 89x). 41-07's route-forward named the multi-copy
 * `@libp2p/interface` registrar skew as the prime suspect; 41-08's diagnosis
 * (41-08-FRET-REGISTRAR-SKEW-DIAGNOSIS.md) FALSIFIED that hypothesis (Registrar is a
 * single-copy `libp2p`-owned class; `@libp2p/interface` exports only types + two
 * `Symbol.for()`-keyed capability tags) and instead found + reproduced a REAL defect: none of
 * `p2p-fret`'s five outbound RPC senders (`sendPing`, `fetchNeighbors`, `announceNeighbors`,
 * `sendMaybeAct`, `sendLeave`) passed `{ runOnLimitedConnection: true }`, so every FRET dial over
 * a circuit-relay-v2 "limited" connection (the on-device NAT-only reachability shape between
 * strand-cohort members) threw `LimitedConnectionError` before multistream-select ever ran. The
 * fix (at the time) EXTENDED the same `p2p-fret` patch (41-06's async-completeness hunks kept
 * byte-identical) with `runOnLimitedConnection: true` at all eight call-site branches across the
 * five senders.
 *
 * 260715-keg ADOPTION (patch dropped in favor of `p2p-fret ^0.6.0`): a Node relay-gate experiment
 * (`relay-multi-peer-smoke.mjs`, 2026-07-15) proved unpatched `p2p-fret@0.6.0` forms the strand
 * cohort (STRAND-COHORT SMOKE PASS, `strandPeers 2/2`, reproducible 3/3) where the hand-patched
 * `0.4.0` cannot (FAIL, `strandPeers 0/0`). `0.6.0`'s `openRpcStream()` centralizes stream opening
 * with `{ runOnLimitedConnection: true, negotiateFully: false }` and prefers direct-over-limited —
 * carrying the 41-08 `runOnLimitedConnection` fix AND additional cohort-formation fixes upstream.
 * The local `p2p-fret-npm-0.4.0-*.patch` (41-06's async-completeness hunks + the 41-08
 * runOnLimitedConnection hunks) is RETIRED entirely — dropped in favor of a bare `^0.6.0`
 * resolution. This spec section inverts to lock the NEW reality: NO p2p-fret patch exists under
 * `.yarn/patches/`, and the root `package.json` bare `p2p-fret` resolution key targets a bare
 * (non-`patch:`) semver range `>=0.6.0` — a silent revert to the retired `0.4.0` patch string
 * fails these assertions immediately (it starts with the `patch:` protocol marker). The
 * `@optimystic/db-p2p` patch (identifyPush + single-slash protocolPrefix) is UNAFFECTED and stays
 * locked exactly as before.
 *
 * 41-10 EXTENSION (diagnosis-only — NO new patch/resolution): the 41-09 device n=4 re-prove on
 * the `^0.6.0` substrate localized the residual wall to strand-node relay-ADDRESS ROUTING across
 * the emulator NAT (`relayAddrsPerDrone=0`, `NoValidAddressesError` 56x, `UnsupportedProtocolError`
 * 52x) despite the control network forming fine. 41-10's diagnosis
 * (41-10-STRAND-RELAY-ROUTING-DIAGNOSIS.md) REFUTES the prime suspect (the app's relay-qualified
 * `STRAND_RELAY_LISTEN_ADDRS` does reach the strand node's `addresses.listen` — traced file:line
 * through `cadre-node.js`/`strand-instance-manager.js`/`libp2p-node-base.js`) and instead
 * CONFIRMS, via a Node/loopback reproduction, a shared-PeerId relay-reservation/hop-connect
 * collision: the control node and every per-strand libp2p node instance share one PeerId and dial
 * the same relay, and `@libp2p/circuit-relay-v2`'s server-side reservation store + hop-connect
 * delivery are keyed solely by PeerId — a sibling's hop-connect meant for the strand node's own
 * connection can be delivered to the control node's connection instead. This extension locks the
 * presence of the new `STRAND-RELAY-ROUTING SMOKE` Node-gate probe added to
 * `relay-multi-peer-smoke.js` (the config-divergence check + the shared-identity collision
 * sub-check) — a silent revert of either would remove this diagnosis's regression coverage with
 * no other signal changing. NO new patch/resolution assertion is added (no fix landed this plan);
 * all prior db-p2p-patch + p2p-fret-^0.6.0-no-patch + app-parity assertions above stay unchanged.
 *
 * 2026-08-05 DB-P2P PATCH RETIREMENT (supersedes the "UNAFFECTED and stays locked exactly as
 * before" clause in the 260715-keg paragraph above): the `@optimystic/db-p2p` patch has now
 * followed p2p-fret's path. Both hunks it carried were upstreamed — identifyPush in >= 0.16.3 (the
 * floor this spec's own resolution assertion pins) and the single-slash `protocolPrefix` alongside
 * it — and the repo moved to an unpatched `@optimystic/db-p2p@0.18.0`, so the patch file was
 * dropped. Three assertions here read that file's CONTENT and could therefore never pass again;
 * they are inverted to lock the new reality (NO db-p2p patch under `.yarn/patches/`), exactly as
 * the p2p-fret assertions were inverted at 260715-keg.
 *
 * No coverage is lost. The fixes themselves are verified against the INSTALLED DIST rather than a
 * diff ("the installed db-p2p passes the slash-STRIPPED protocolPrefix to identify/identifyPush"),
 * which is the stronger check: a patch can sit in `.yarn/patches/` unapplied, but the dist is what
 * actually boots. What the inverted assertions still catch is a silent re-add — someone re-pinning
 * an older db-p2p or reintroducing a local hunk.

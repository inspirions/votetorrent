/**
 * ios-association-ceremony.spec.ts — the iOS associate ceremony, end to end, on REAL Apple bytes.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. Phase 51 had two halves that had each been proven alone and never together:
 *
 *   - `ios-hardware-attestation.spec.ts` proves the VERIFIER accepts a real iPhone 13 submission
 *     (spike 085 leg 9), but stops at `verify()` — it never writes a row.
 *   - `association-ios-cross-field.spec.ts` proves the BUILDER's iOS validators, but against
 *     `{} as unknown as IAssociationEngine` — a stub. It never reaches `associate()` or a database.
 *   - `association.spec.ts` drives the full ceremony against a real Quereus DB, but every
 *     attestation in it is synthetic and Android-shaped.
 *
 * So `AssociationAssociateBuilder.commit()` had never once run with genuine iOS hardware bytes.
 * That is the gap this file closes: real captured attestation -> real builder -> real
 * `AssociationEngine.associate()` -> real `AppAttestVerifier` -> real signed rows in a real DB.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE. It is a Node spec, not a device run. The voter app's own screen wiring
 * (`ConfirmationScreen.onConfirm`) is NOT exercised here, and `produceIos()` does not run — its
 * OUTPUT is replayed from the hardware capture. `produceIos` itself was proven on an iPhone 13 on
 * 2026-08-25; what remains unproven after this file is the app UI driving these two proven halves.
 * Do not describe this spec as "the ceremony ran on iOS".
 *
 * ONE PINNED RANDOM VALUE, and why it is faithful. The captured attestation is cryptographically
 * bound to spike 085's exact `nonce` and `deviceKey`: BOUND_DIGEST is `Digest(nonce, deviceKey)`,
 * and the assertion and the proof-of-possession both sign digests derived from it. Meanwhile
 * `issueAttestationChallenge` mints its nonce with `crypto.randomUUID()`. So the ONLY way real
 * bytes can meet the real challenge path is to pin that one random draw. Everything else in
 * `issueAttestationChallenge` runs for real — the 'vrg' AdminSigning ceremony, the signature, the
 * `AttestationChallenge` insert and all its CHECKs. Spike 085 leg 9 established the same point from
 * the other direction: `produceIos` reads `nonce` and `deviceKey` and nothing else, so a pinned
 * UUID is the same input by construction.

// src/intake/types.ts — Phase 62 Plan 14 (D-03, D-04, D-29, D-32, D-46)
//
// This module is the intake key-and-policy layer between 62-01's tables
// (`UserEncryptionKey`, `AuthorityIntakePolicy`) and 62-04's envelope/vault:
// officer encryption-key publication, D-04/D-32 recipient resolution, the
// D-03/D-04 sealer and opener, and the D-29/D-46 intake policy read/write.
//
// Invariant carried throughout: an opened plaintext never leaves process
// memory. Nothing in this module writes, caches or logs plaintext bytes, and
// `IntakeError`/`IntakeOpenResult` messages never carry a byte of it. This
// module does NOT widen T-62-01-10 — the pre-existing, open finding that
// `RegistrationEngine.submitRegistrationRequest` persists the (possibly
// still-plaintext) `Payload` on the replicated strand DB. That finding is
// referenced here only; fixing it needs a schema change
// (`RegistrationRequest.PayloadCidValid` binds `Payload` to the requester's
// own signed `PayloadCid`) and is tracked separately, pending a user decision.
//
// Every 62-04 name this module consumes (`EnvelopeBinding`, `EnvelopeRecipient`,
// `EnvelopeOpenFailureReason`, `IKeyVault`, `sealToRecipients`, `openEnvelope`,
// ...) is imported from `../crypto/index.js` and never redeclared here.

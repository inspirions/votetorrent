// Phase 999.1 D-01/D-02/D-03 — Tids for ElectionsEngine batches are allocated
// through the shared durable, peer-safe allocator (`tid-allocator.ts`,
// namespace 'elections') instead of a process-local `Date.now()`-seeded
// counter. See tid-allocator.ts for the D-07 hybrid seed / D-09
// reserve-before-use / D-10 per-namespace serialization rationale that
// replaces the WR-16/WR-25 heuristic this module used to carry.
//
// [Deviation — Rule 1 auto-fix bug, 999.1-03] The elections byte-alignment
// contract (documented on createElection below) requires that whatever Tid a
// caller peeks BEFORE signing is the EXACT Tid createElection later consumes
// — with NO drift, even across the async gap of a real signing round-trip.
// The shared allocator's `peekTid` is explicitly NOT safe for this: it
// recomputes `max(persisted, Date.now())` fresh on every call (no persist),
// so on a namespace's first-ever allocation (every fresh test/network DB —
// no persisted TidHighWater row yet) a peek and a LATER independent allocate
// can each observe a different Date.now() and diverge, silently breaking the
// signed Digest's Tid vs the INSERT's context.Tid (InsertValid CHECK fails).
// Fix: this module reserves the T/T+1 pair EAGERLY (via allocateTid, which
// IS persist-before-return/durable per D-09) the first time either
// `peekNextElectionTid` or `seedElectionSigning` asks for it, and caches the
// reservation per-`Database`-handle until `createElection` consumes it. A
// second peek before consumption returns the SAME cached pair (still
// peek-safe — no re-reservation); `createElection` called with no prior peek
// falls back to a fresh `allocateTid(db, 'elections', 2)` reservation.

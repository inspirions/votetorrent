// src/keyholder/keyholder-dkg-engine.ts — KeyholderDkgEngine (62-17: D-13,
// D-14, D-16, D-19, D-26). Drives 62-05's split-round FROST DKG through
// 62-02's signed, append-only `KeyholderDkgMessage` strand rows.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The round table (D-19)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   R0 (commit)   -- a sha256 hash binding electionId/revision/attempt to the
//                    sender's own round-1 package, so a rushing peer cannot
//                    tailor its R1 after seeing others' (commit-reveal).
//   R1 (reveal)   -- the Feldman commitment vector and Schnorr proof of
//                    knowledge (DkgRound1Wire), checked against its own R0.
//   R2 (shares)   -- EncryptedShare[], one per OTHER roster member, each
//                    encrypted ONLY to that recipient's keyholder-signed
//                    KeyholderDkgBinding.DkgPublicKey (D-26).
//   R3 (ack/complaint) -- every received share is decrypted and verified
//                    before an ack; a bad share is complained with public,
//                    reader-checkable evidence (verifyComplaintEvidence).
//   R4 (result)   -- the agreed joint public key Y and group commitments.
//                    Once every live keyholder's R4 agrees (and none
//                    dissents -- the schema's AllKeyholdersAgree/NoDissent),
//                    `publish` writes the write-once ElectionKey row.
//
// Numbered rules 1-9 (gates, boundary evaluation, roster rule, cap) are
// documented in `dkg-evaluator.ts`'s header; this engine is the DRIVER that
// turns `planDkgAction`'s verdict into one signed row.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The round-secret alias lifecycle (D-16)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Step 1 (`keyholderDkgRoundSecretAlias(e, r, a, 1, self)`) holds the
// dealer's own polynomial coefficients plus its UNREVEALED R1 package from
// the moment round 0 is posted until round 2 is posted. Step 2 is written
// BEFORE step 1 is deleted (crash safety -- see `dkg-vault.ts`'s header) and
// itself deleted right after round 4 is posted. `cleanupVault` additionally
// sweeps every attempt's round-secret aliases once that attempt is known
// ABORTED. The own share is swept only when its PRODUCING attempt is proven
// aborted: `executePostRound4` writes a non-secret marker
// (`keyholderDkgShareAttemptAlias`) naming the attempt beside the share, and
// `cleanupVault` deletes the share (then the marker) only when the marker
// parses AND names an aborted attempt AND no ElectionKey exists. The old
// attempt-agnostic sweep ("any attempt aborted, no key yet") deleted the
// FRESH share of a retried DKG right after round 4 (V-1), leaving a complete
// election key no one could release. A missing or unparseable marker never
// deletes the share (fail-safe toward keeping key material).
//
// No device ever holds the full election private key: `src/keyholder/*`
// never calls `combineSecret`/`reconstructGroupSecret` (D-16 grep gate).
// Each keyholder ends with exactly one 32-byte signing share, raw, under
// `keyholderDkgShareAlias(electionId, revision, userId)`.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Biometric-prompt budget
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Each round-step action reads the vault AT MOST once (`getSecret` on the
// round-secret or receiving-key alias) and signs AT MOST once
// (`signer.sign`) -- `KEYHOLDER_DKG_ROUND_SECRET_POLICY`/
// `KEYHOLDER_DKG_RECEIVING_KEY_POLICY`/`KEYHOLDER_SHARE_POLICY` all require
// user auth, so a single `advanceDkg` pass never prompts a keyholder more
// than once per round it actually advances.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two-tier residual (T-62-02-13)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `remove-disqualified` deletes a Keyholder row through a TIER-2 path --
// `Keyholder` carries no `check on delete` (62-02's deliberate deferral).
// Any evidence used is a transcript-proven fault from permanent, insert-only
// rows, the delete is idempotent, and any live participant may run it. A
// raw-handle re-add is re-removed on the next pass (the planner's
// `remove-disqualified` priority runs before any post or publish).

// Security review (D-25) — protocol composition — dated 2026-10-01, 62-17 Task 3
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The 62-05 review (`src/crypto/dkg.ts`) covers the primitives in isolation.
// This review covers how THIS engine composes them over signed strand rows:
// does it schedule rounds in the right order, verify what it reads, map
// verdicts to the right disqualification, and leave no full key or stale
// secret on any device. ASVS L1: every HIGH finding is fixed (or the
// composing control already closes it) before this section was written.
//
//  1. Commit-reveal ordering: `planDkgAction`'s `post-round` branch never
//     schedules round 1 until every roster member's round-0 row is visible
//     (`awaitingUserIds` at round 0 blocks everyone). Evidence: "gates
//     passing with zero rows ... planDkgAction returns post-round-0", "with
//     4 of 5 R0 rows present, planDkgAction returns none ... and never
//     post-round-1" (`dkg-evaluator.spec.ts`). Negative controls (a), (b).
//  2. R1 commit and proof of knowledge are verified publicly (read-side, by
//     EVERY node, not just the dealer's peers) and failures are attributed
//     to the sender. Evidence: "an R1 that differs from its R0 commit gives
//     aborted/faults with commit-mismatch", "a tampered proof of knowledge
//     gives invalid-round1" (`dkg-evaluator.spec.ts`). Control (a).
//  3. Every received share is verified with `verifyDealerShare` before an
//     ack and before the round-4 `dkgRound3` call (`executePostRound3`,
//     `executePostRound4`). Evidence: scenario B (`dkg.spec.ts`) — a
//     perturbed share is caught and complained, never silently acked.
//     Control (c).
//  4. Verdict-to-disqualification mapping (dealer-fault -> the dealer,
//     complainant-fault -> the complainant, unresolved -> nobody, abort
//     only). Evidence: the five "round-3 verdicts" cases in
//     `dkg-evaluator.spec.ts`, plus scenarios B (dealer-fault) and D
//     (complainant-fault) in `dkg.spec.ts`. Control (d).
//  5. Boundary determinism: a round is evaluated only once every roster
//     member's row for it is visible, so every node reaches the identical
//     verdict regardless of arrival order. Evidence: "with one complaint
//     present and another member's R3 missing, the attempt is still
//     collecting" (`dkg-evaluator.spec.ts`). Control (k).
//  6. Participants come from the LIVE `Keyholder` table
//     (`loadSnapshot`'s `liveRoster` query), and a transcript-proven
//     disqualification is removed (tier 2, see item 15) before the next
//     attempt's round 0 and before any publication — `planDkgAction`
//     prioritizes `remove-disqualified` over every other action. Evidence:
//     scenario B ("removed-disqualified fires first"), scenario C (a
//     raw-handle re-add is re-removed). Control (e).
//  7. The attempt cap matches the schema's `AttemptValid` bound
//     (`DKG_MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3`, `@votetorrent/vote-core`), and
//     `keyholderDkgRoundSecretAlias` independently bounds `attempt` to
//     `1..DKG_MAX_ATTEMPTS` as a second, defense-in-depth gate BEFORE any
//     row is even built. Evidence: scenario E (attempts-exhausted at 3, no
//     `Attempt > 3` row). Control (f).
//  8. `k` comes from the 'mel'-signed `ElectionRevision.KeyholderThreshold`
//     (`loadSnapshot`), never from the roster size, and the published
//     `ElectionKey.Threshold` must equal it (schema `ThresholdMatchesRevision`).
//     Evidence: scenario G (`threshold-out-of-range` gate). Control (g).
//  9. R2 shares are encrypted only to the recipient's keyholder-signed
//     `KeyholderDkgBinding.DkgPublicKey` (`executePostRound2` reads
//     `snapshot.bindings`, never a signing key) — D-26. Control (h).
// 10. R4 agreement and the published `ElectionKey`'s consistency with the
//     agreed `Y`, the derived group commitments, the revision's threshold
//     and the agreed roster length (V-2) are all checked; a malformed
//     GroupCommitments column is guarded (`parseElectionKeyCommitments`,
//     `[]` on the record means "malformed on the row") and reads as a
//     mismatch, never a throw. Both are checked (`evaluateDkgRevision`'s final
//     `electionKeyConsistent` pass; `verifyDkgTranscript`). Evidence: the
//     two "ElectionKey consistency" cases in `dkg-evaluator.spec.ts`, and
//     scenario A's `verifyDkgTranscript` assertion.
// 11. No full key on any device (D-16): `grep -vE '^\s*(//|\*|/\*)'
//     src/keyholder/*.ts | grep -cE "combineSecret|reconstructGroupSecret"`
//     prints 0. Scenario A additionally proves the AFFIRMATIVE side —
//     every vault holds exactly one 32-byte `keyholderDkgShareAlias` share,
//     reconstructible (TEST-SIDE ONLY, via `reconstructGroupSecret`) from
//     any 3-of-5 subset to a scalar whose public key is `Y`.
// 12. Round-secret custody: `keyholderDkgRoundSecretAlias` with
//     `KEYHOLDER_DKG_ROUND_SECRET_POLICY.requireUserAuth === true`; the
//     step-2 record is written BEFORE step 1 is deleted
//     (`executePostRound2`); `cleanupVault` sweeps every ABORTED attempt's
//     round-secret aliases (and, once `complete`, every attempt's) after
//     every action. The SHARE sweep is attempt-bound (V-1): only a share
//     whose attempt marker names an aborted attempt, with no ElectionKey,
//     is deleted; a marker-less share is never deleted. Evidence: scenarios
//     B and D (every honest share survives a retry and releases). Scenario A ("round-secret aliases all
//     swept"), scenario E ("no vault holds a round-secret alias"). Control
//     (j).
// 13. Read-side signature verification of replicated rows: `loadSnapshot`
//     recomputes `SignatureValid(...)  or SignatureValidP256(...)` over every
//     `KeyholderDkgMessage`/`ElectionKey` row in SQL against the row's OWN
//     stored key. That proves only that the row is consistent with that key.
//     AUTHORSHIP (that the key belonged to `SenderUserId` /
//     `PublisherUserId` when the row was written) rests on the insert-time
//     CHECK (`SenderKeyIsUsers` / `PublisherKeyIsUsers`) on immutable
//     NoUpdate/NoDelete rows, and is deliberately NOT re-required at read
//     (WR-02, mirroring 62-39's CR-02 release reads): a later rotation or
//     revocation must not turn a healthy transcript into `failed /
//     election-key-mismatch`. `evaluateDkgRevision` drops a `signatureValid:
//     false` row into `invalidRows` and never attributes it. Control (i).
//     A revoked key still cannot write: `advanceDkg` checks the current key
//     and the schema refuses the insert.
//     ACCEPTED SCOPE (T-62-42-05): since 62-42, rows signed by a key later
//     revoked stay valid for EVERY consumer of `loadSnapshot`: `getDkgStatus`,
//     `verifyDkgTranscript`, `advanceDkg`'s `evaluateDkgRevision` /
//     `planDkgAction` (complaints, disqualification, ElectionKey
//     publication) and `cleanupVault`. If a key is revoked BECAUSE it was
//     compromised, its earlier rows keep counting in all of them.
//     REPLICATION RE-VALIDATION: only partly established. The installed
//     optimystic validator re-executes a pend's statements through the
//     registered engine (db-core/dist/src/transaction/validator.js:100,
//     `registration.engine.execute(transaction)`), which would evaluate the
//     insert CHECKs, and cluster members call it from
//     db-p2p/dist/src/cluster/cluster-repo.js:976 (`validatePendOperations`).
//     NOT ESTABLISHED: that this deployment registers that validator (no
//     `createQuereusValidator` call was found under @serfab/cadre-core/dist,
//     and `unvalidatablePendPolicy` defaults to 'accept' at
//     cluster-repo.js:239), and that block-level sync/restore paths re-run
//     the CHECKs at all. A replication path that applied rows without
//     re-running insert CHECKs would let a self-signed row impersonate a
//     participant.
//     REJECTED variant: drop the membership requirement only once
//     an ElectionKey is published; a row's validity must not depend on whether
//     a LATER row exists, and a pre-publish rotation could still invalidate an
//     honest participant's earlier rounds mid-DKG (DS5 pins that a mid-DKG
//     rotation completes under the current read; its negative control
//     re-adds the membership EXISTS and turns it red).
// 14. No secret bytes in error messages, and no `console` use. The
//     `KeyholderDkgError`/`KeyVaultError` codes and ids are the only error
//     content; `decodeDkgRoundVaultRecord`'s own corruption messages name
//     no field value. Evidence: scenario L asserts the thrown message
//     matches no 64-hex run. `grep -vE '^\s*(//|\*|/\*)' src/keyholder/*.ts
//     | grep -cE "combineSecret|reconstructGroupSecret|console\."` prints 0.
// 15. Two-tier residual (T-62-02-13, inherited from 62-02): `Keyholder`
//     carries no `check on delete`, so `remove-disqualified` is a tier-2
//     path — any live participant may run it, on transcript-proven evidence
//     only, idempotently. A raw-handle re-add is re-removed on the next
//     honest pass (scenario C). The residual for a client that never runs
//     this engine at all (and so never re-removes a re-added row) transfers
//     to the still-open T-62-02-13 Keyholder-delete-authorization gap —
//     not re-opened or re-designed here.
// 16. Liveness residual: there is NO automatic timeout or action (user
//     ruling 2026-10-07) — an absent participant stalls the DKG with
//     `awaitingUserIds` naming them. Since 62-139 a STATUS READ flags
//     `overdueUserIds` (the awaited keyholders) once the current round has
//     been open for `DKG_ROUND_DEADLINE_MS`, by the resolver rule of
//     evaluator rule 10: the earliest answer caps the latest opening
//     candidate, so neither the flagged keyholder nor the first answer can
//     move the deadline later, and candidates more than 5 minutes ahead of
//     the reader are ignored. The flag is advisory and approximate (it can
//     fire early on a back-dated or slow-clock answer) and is computed only
//     here at the status read: time never enters the evaluator, and
//     `advanceDkg` / `planDkgAction` never read it. Officers decide; the only
//     in-app action is to ask the keyholder to open this election's keyholder
//     screen (the driver is pull-only). There is NO in-app way to replace a
//     silent keyholder today: `ElectionEngine.revokeKeyholder` is engine-only
//     with no permission check (todo
//     2026-10-02-keyholder-delete-has-no-check-and-revoke-checks-no-permission)
//     and no product path bumps ElectionRevision (adjustElection writes only
//     ProposedElectionRevision); that is an open decision for the user. If a
//     revoke does happen, the roster-rule fallback (rule 6) turns it into a
//     clean `roster-changed` abort. Signer-claimed timestamps can move the
//     flag earlier (back-dating) but cannot cause any fault. Evidence:
//     scenario H, dkg-round-deadline.spec.ts.
// 17. Lag residual (accepted): a replication lag that makes one node see a
//     roster change before another can consume at most one extra attempt
//     (the roster-rule fallback aborts that attempt as `roster-changed`
//     rather than publishing on a stale roster), bounded by the 3-attempt
//     cap like any other abort.
// 18. Inherited A6/A7 (from 62-05, unchanged by this plan): A6 — a
//     complaint without a DLEQ proof cannot distinguish a lying dealer from
//     a lying complainant when the key-commitment tag itself mismatches, so
//     the verdict is `unresolved` (denial of service only — scenario E
//     shows this costs at most all 3 attempts). A7 — Joint-Feldman DKG bias
//     under a rushing/aborting adversary: the commit-reveal in R0 removes
//     the RUSHING choice, but a participant can still bias the joint key by
//     roughly one bit per self-disqualifying abort-and-retry, bounded by
//     the SAME 3-attempt cap. Both residuals stay OPEN, surfaced to the
//     user/reviewer (not claimed closed by this plan), and GJKR (Pedersen
//     commitments plus a public extraction/complaint phase) is the named
//     alternative if either ever needs closing — not built here, since it
//     would be additional hand-rolled protocol logic beyond what D-25
//     sanctions.
// 19. Hermes proof debt (inherited from 62-05's own dkg.ts review, and this
//     engine's own driver on top of it): the composed round driver
//     (`KeyholderDkgEngine`) has run only in Node, over `InMemoryTestKeyVault`
//     and an in-memory Quereus `Database`. No device run has been made on
//     Hermes or against a hardware-backed vault adapter. Tracked for 62-30
//     in the D-23 "code-complete, unverified" style — never claim device
//     proof for this review.
//
// Negative control results (temporarily mutate the named file, run the
// targeted spec(s), record the failing title(s), then `git checkout --` the
// file to restore):
//
//   (a) Skip `verifyRound1Commit` in the evaluator's round-1 fault check.
//       NOT LIVE-MUTATED: the permission system's Security-Weaken
//       classifier refused this edit (disabling a signature/commit
//       verification call), and per its own instructions the SAME outcome
//       was not re-attempted through a different phrasing or tool. The
//       control is instead evidenced structurally: "an R1 that differs
//       from its R0 commit gives aborted/faults with commit-mismatch on
//       that sender" (`dkg-evaluator.spec.ts`) is a POSITIVE-path test that
//       only passes because `verifyRound1Commit` actually detects the
//       mismatch — removing the call would make this exact assertion fail
//       (`ev.disqualified.find(...).reason` would be `undefined`, not
//       `'commit-mismatch'`), by direct code inspection of the `if`/`else
//       if` chain at the round-1 fault site. Recorded as a gap in live
//       coverage, not in protection — flagged for the human reviewer.
//   (b) Let `planDkgAction` plan round 1 while an R0 is missing (forced the
//       `post-round` branch's `awaitingUserIds.includes(selfUserId)` guard
//       to `true` unconditionally).
//       RED: "with 4 of 5 R0 rows present, planDkgAction returns none for
//       posted members and never post-round-1; awaitingUserIds is the
//       missing member" (`dkg-evaluator.spec.ts`) — planned `post-round
//       0/1` instead of `none` for an already-posted member.
//   (c) Ack a decrypted share without `verifyDealerShare` in
//       `executePostRound3` (forced the check to `false && ...`).
//       RED: scenario B (`dkg.spec.ts`) — the bad share is never
//       complained; `dkgRound3`'s OWN internal check then throws
//       `"share failed verification against the dealer's own commitment"`
//       at round 4 instead (a second, independent layer catches it, but
//       NOT as the intended round-3 complaint — recorded as a defense-in-
//       depth finding, not a silent pass).
//   (d) Map `unresolved` to disqualifying the complainant with
//       `false-complaint` in the evaluator's round-3 verdict loop.
//       RED: "a random-point sharedSecret gives aborted/unresolved-
//       complaint with an empty disqualified list and unresolvedComplaints
//       1" — got `abortReason: 'faults'` instead of `'unresolved-complaint'`.
//   (e) Make `executeRemoveDisqualified` a no-op (never issues the
//       `delete from Keyholder`).
//       RED: scenario B — `runDkgToQuiescence` throws `"exceeded maxPasses
//       (60)"` after 4 minutes of real time. This is `planDkgAction`'s OWN
//       priority ordering working as designed: `remove-disqualified` is
//       checked BEFORE `publish`/`post-round` for every eligible
//       participant, so an un-removed disqualified member blocks ALL
//       further progress rather than letting the DKG silently continue
//       around a raw-handle survivor — an availability-only, fail-closed
//       outcome. The control ALSO proves a second, deeper backstop by code
//       inspection (not independently triggered by this run, since the
//       planner-priority protection fires first): `ElectionKey`'s
//       `ParticipantsAreKeyholders` CHECK (`new.Participants = (select
//       count(*) from Keyholder ...)`) would reject a publish attempt that
//       ever got as far as computing `Participants` from the engine's own
//       (disqualification-aware) roster length against a DB that still
//       counted the un-removed row — the same "provably non-divergent
//       given an earlier control" shape as 62-05 dkg.ts's own F-01 finding.
//   (f) Raise the evaluator's attempt cap to 4 (loop bound and both
//       `attempt === DKG_MAX_ATTEMPTS` cap checks).
//       RED: scenario E — `KeyholderDkgError: keyholderDkgRoundSecretAlias:
//       attempt must be 1..DKG_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, thrown from
//       `executePostRound0` before any attempt-4 row is ever built. The
//       alias function's own defensive bound is a SECOND, independent cap
//       below the evaluator's — the schema's `AttemptValid` CHECK is a
//       third, never reached in this run because the alias guard fires
//       first.
//   (g) Publish with `Threshold = roster.length` instead of
//       `evaluation.threshold` (the revision's signed `KeyholderThreshold`).
//       RED: scenario A — `Quereus error (code 19): CHECK constraint
//       failed: ThresholdMatchesRevision`.
//   (h) Encrypt R2 to `signer.signingPublicKey` instead of
//       `snapshot.bindings[...].dkgPublicKey`.
//       RED: scenario A — final `status.phase` is `'failed'` instead of
//       `'complete'` (every recipient's `decryptShare` fails against the
//       wrong key, producing a complaint storm that exhausts all 3
//       attempts).
//   (i) Ignore `signatureValid` in the evaluator (never route a `false` row
//       into `invalidRows`).
//       RED: "a row with signatureValid false is treated as absent, is
//       listed in invalidRows, and never disqualifies the claimed sender"
//       — `invalidRows` came back `[]` instead of containing the row.
//   (j) Skip the `cleanupVault` calls in `advanceDkg`'s round-driving loop.
//       RED: scenario E — `readRoundRecord` for a BYGONE aborted attempt's
//       step-2 alias returned the record instead of `null`
//       (`"Dealer attempt 1 step 2: expected {...} to equal null"`). (Scenario
//       A alone does NOT catch this control — its own round-secret aliases
//       are already deleted inline by `executePostRound2`/`executePostRound4`
//       on the one successful attempt; the dedicated sweep is load-bearing
//       only for ABORTED attempts' leftovers, which is exactly what
//       scenario E isolates.)
//   (k) Decide a complaint abort as soon as ANY round-3 row is a complaint,

//   F-01 | LOW    | accepted — control (a) could not be live-mutated (see

//         positive-path test instead of a live red/green cycle. No
//         HIGH/MEDIUM severity — the SAME check is additionally exercised,
//         un-mutated, by three other round-1 fault cases in this run.
//   F-02 | INFO   | accepted — control (e)'s SECOND backstop
//         (`ParticipantsAreKeyholders`) is provably reachable only if the
//         planner-priority protection (which this run DID trigger) is
//         ALSO bypassed; not independently triggered here, same
//         "provably non-divergent given an earlier control" shape as
//         62-05 dkg.ts's F-01. No fix needed.
//
// No HIGH or MEDIUM finding was raised by this review.
//
// Residuals (OPEN, not claimed safe — see items 15-18 above):
//   T-62-02-13 (tier-2 Keyholder delete, inherited) — transferred, not
//   re-designed. A6 and A7 (inherited from 62-05) — bounded by the
//   3-attempt cap, surfaced to the user/reviewer.
//
// Hermes device proof debt: see item 19. Tracked for 62-30 — never claim
// device proof for this review.

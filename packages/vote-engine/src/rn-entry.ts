//
// NetworksEngine is intentionally NOT in src/index.ts or networks/index.ts:
// we export it ONLY here so there is a single controlled re-export path.
// Phase-14 proved Metro CAN bundle NetworksEngine; the omission from the main
// barrel is deliberate to avoid pulling it into non-RN consumers via the default
// '.' subpath.
//
// Do NOT add `export * from './networks/index.js'` here — that would
// double-export MockNetworksEngine alongside NetworksEngine.
// 49-D26a-LOCAL: the canonical P-256 verifier, exported so on-device proofs can assert a real
// Keystore signature against THE SAME function the schema's SignatureValidP256 CHECK calls.
// Verifying with a hand-rolled noble call instead would prove nothing about schema agreement —
// which is the whole point of the encoding contract (base64url digest / hex sig / hex key).

// run it too — without it, the first signed insert fails `Function not found: SignatureValidP256/3`.

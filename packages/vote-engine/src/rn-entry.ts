// src/rn-entry.ts — RN-safe subpath entry (D-01/D-02)
//
// NetworksEngine is intentionally NOT in src/index.ts or networks/index.ts:
// we export it ONLY here so there is a single controlled re-export path.
// Phase-14 proved Metro CAN bundle NetworksEngine; the omission from the main
// barrel is deliberate to avoid pulling it into non-RN consumers via the default
// '.' subpath.
//
// Do NOT add `export * from './networks/index.js'` here — that would
// double-export MockNetworksEngine alongside NetworksEngine.

// Phase 44-02 (D-01, voter-app net-new): the voter app's EngineFactory builds a
// 'registration' engine case — RegistrationEngine was previously reachable only
// from the default '.' subpath (registration/index.js), which is not RN-safe
// per this file's own header convention. Export it here so the RN app layer
// never has to reach past the controlled rn-entry.ts seam. As of Phase 46
// (D-06) BOTH RN apps (voter + authority) build a 'registration' case, so this
// single export serves both.

// file's header rule, the Mock sibling class is NOT re-exported here (screen

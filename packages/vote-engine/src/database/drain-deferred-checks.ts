/**
 * Evaluate every deferred row constraint queued so far in the open transaction, now, and empty
 * the queue.
 *
 * A CHECK that contains a subquery is deferred to COMMIT, so at COMMIT it sees rows the same
 * transaction inserted LATER. The engine calls this right after an insert whose CHECK must judge
 * the table as it stands at that insert (Admin before its Officer rows, each signature-task pair
 * during fan-out). The transaction stays open and atomic: a failing check throws here, and the
 * caller rolls back as for any other failed statement.
 *
 * Quereus 4.x exposed this as `Database.runDeferredRowConstraints()`. 5.0.0 removed that method
 * (ticket debt-connection-lifecycle-contract-check) and kept the queue it called,
 * `getDeferredConstraints().runDeferredRows()`, which is not in the published types. So this
 * reaches the queue directly and refuses loudly if a later Quereus removes it too, never
 * silently skipping the drain (that would move these checks back to COMMIT and change verdicts).

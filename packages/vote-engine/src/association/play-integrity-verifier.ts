/**
 * PlayIntegrityVerifier — the real `IAttestationVerifier` implementation
 * (D-01/D-02/D-04/D-06), replacing `StubAttestationVerifier` behind the
 * unchanged seam. Real platform verification, deferred by the stub, lands
 * here: offline classic-API Google Play Integrity decrypt+verify
 * (`verifiers/play-integrity.ts`) composed with offline Android Keystore
 * hardware Key Attestation cert-chain validation
 * (`verifiers/key-attestation.ts`) — D-01 requires BOTH mechanisms to
 * pass; a single passing half never authorizes association. The stub
 * remains the dev-gate fallback (D-14, `USE_STUB_ATTESTATION_VERIFIER`).
 *
 * Never throws for adversarial input — like `StubAttestationVerifier`,
 * every rejection is an early-returned `{ ok: false, reason }` tuple; the
 * caller (`association-engine.ts:255-261`) converts `!ok` into a thrown
 * `Error` itself.
 *
 * **D-09 — key-provisioning fail-closed check, relocated here.** This check
 * formerly lived at construction time in
 * `apps/VoteTorrentAuthority/src/engines/engine-factory.ts:402-406` (a
 * `throw` inside the factory's `'association'` case when
 * `PLAY_CONSOLE_*_KEY_BASE64` build constants were absent). It now lives as
 * the FIRST statement of `verify()`, gated by the `keysProvisioned`
 * constructor parameter below, so that no other rejection reason (e.g. "no
 * Android platform details") can mask an unprovisioned-keys condition — an
 * unprovisioned verifier must always report the provisioning reason first,
 * regardless of what else is wrong with the submitted attestation. The
 * never-throws contract above is unchanged: this is an early-returned
 * `{ ok: false, reason }` tuple, never a `throw`; `association-engine.ts`'s
 * existing `if (!verification.ok) throw` at `:279-283` is what converts
 * this tuple into fail-closed behavior end to end, and that file is not
 * modified by this relocation. `keysProvisioned` defaults to `true` so
 * every existing three-argument construction site keeps constructing a
 * provisioned verifier unchanged — the authority `EngineFactory` is
 * responsible for threading the real `playConsoleKeysProvisioned` value
 * into the 5th argument (47-09).

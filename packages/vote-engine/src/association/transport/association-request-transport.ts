/**
 * association-request-transport.ts — the D-08/D-18 authority-association-request
 * transport seam.
 *
 * `authority-transport.ts` / `local-authority-transport.ts` (the D-11
 * producer-to-authority seam these files' shape is modeled on) were written
 * assuming exactly ONE real binding today plus a hypothetical future one —
 * "the shape never changes when the real transport plugs in later." It
 * proved exactly one binding, and (D-04) is now superseded for THIS flow.
 *
 * **D-08 explicitly rejects that "prove one, add more later" framing.**
 * `IAssociationRequestTransport` requires **two real bindings from day
 * one** — a filesystem drop-file binding and a pull-based REST binding,
 * both named in `doc/registration.md:12`, both P2P-free, both exercised by
 * **one shared conformance suite with identical assertions**. Two
 * interchangeable bindings are what make this an abstraction rather than a
 * speculative indirection; one binding would prove only that the interface
 * compiles.
 *
 * A **third**, peer-cluster binding may be written and is
 * **reserved-and-skipped**: it never counts toward a pass and its failure
 * gates nothing. **Node and jest results are not verification for it** —
 * this project has repeatedly had "implemented but unproven" read as
 * "done."
 *
 * Security property: a transport receives either a completed `Signature` or
 * a digest->`Signature` callback, and **NEVER a raw private key**, on BOTH
 * legs (`submitRequest` and `submitAttestation`) — matching
 * `IAssociationEngine`'s own methods exactly. A binding that crosses a
 * process, a filesystem, or a network therefore never has key material to
 * leak (D-01/D-08).
 *
 * D-18: association is NOT single-round-trip the way registration is. The
 * authority must hand the device a nonce BEFORE the device can attest,
 * because the nonce is bound INTO the attestation itself. This seam
 * therefore carries a distinct second voter-to-authority message,
 * `submitAttestation`, rather than a widened `submitRequest` with an
 * optional payload — the self-signed ask and the self-signed
 * attestation-answer assert structurally different things with different
 * validity rules, and the shared conformance suite asserts each SEPARATELY.
 *
 * This comment makes no claim that the `'vrg'` scope is enforced anywhere in
 * this seam.

 *
 * Why it belongs on the seam rather than in one binding: D-08's whole claim
 * is "one shared conformance suite with identical assertions" across the
 * bindings. WR-10's recorded history on the registration seam: two of three
 * bindings coerced instead of checked (`status as RegistrationRequestStatus`
 * after a bare `typeof === 'string'`, or with no check at all), so a drop
 * file or a strand row carrying an unknown code flowed through as a
 * well-typed decision notice and every downstream `switch (notice.status)`
 * silently took no branch — a silent drop of a DECISION, which is the one
 * thing this seam's own contract says must never be lost ("re-delivery is
 * permitted; loss is not").
 *
 * Why a THROW and not a skip: a code outside this set means the producer and
 * the schema disagree about the vocabulary. That is not a malformed row to
 * step over — it will mis-decide every subsequent notice from the same

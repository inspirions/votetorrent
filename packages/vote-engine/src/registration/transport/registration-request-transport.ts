/**
 * registration-request-transport.ts — the D-01 authority-registration-request
 * transport seam.
 *
 * `authority-transport.ts` (the D-11 producer-to-authority seam this file's
 * shape is modeled on) was written assuming exactly ONE real binding today
 * plus a hypothetical future one — "the shape never changes when the real
 * transport plugs in later." It proved exactly one binding.
 *
 * **D-01 explicitly rejects that "prove one, add more later" framing for
 * this seam.** `IRegistrationRequestTransport` requires **two real bindings
 * from day one** — a filesystem drop-file binding and a pull-based REST
 * binding, both named in `doc/registration.md:12`, both P2P-free, both
 * exercised by **one shared conformance suite with identical assertions**.
 * Two interchangeable bindings are what make this an abstraction rather than
 * a speculative indirection; one binding would prove only that the interface
 * compiles.
 *
 * A **third**, peer-cluster binding exists and is **code-complete, unverified**
 * (D-11). Its conformance branch is reserved-and-skipped: it
 * never counts toward a pass and its failure gates nothing. **Node and jest
 * results are not verification for it** — this project has repeatedly had
 * "implemented but unproven" read as "done."
 *
 * Security property: a transport receives either a completed `Signature` or
 * a digest→`Signature` callback, and **NEVER a raw private key**, matching
 * `IRegistrationEngine`'s own methods exactly. A binding that crosses a
 * process, a filesystem, or a network therefore never has key material to
 * leak (D-01/D-19).
 *
 * This comment makes no claim that the `'vrg'` scope is enforced anywhere in
 * this seam.

 * Why it belongs on the seam rather than in one binding: D-01's whole claim is "one shared
 * conformance suite with identical assertions" across the bindings. Two of the three coerced
 * instead of checked (`status as RegistrationRequestStatus` after a bare `typeof === 'string'`,
 * or with no check at all), so a drop file or a strand row carrying `"approved"` or `"deleted"`
 * flowed through as a well-typed `RegistrationDecisionNotice` and every downstream
 * `switch (notice.status)` silently took no branch — a silent drop of a DECISION, which is the one
 * thing this seam's own contract says must never be lost ("re-delivery is permitted; loss is not").
 *
 * Why a THROW and not a skip: a code outside this set means the producer and the schema disagree
 * about the vocabulary. That is not a malformed row to step over — it will mis-decide every
 * subsequent notice from the same producer too, so it must be surfaced.

 * p2p-staging-seam.ts — the shared D-03/D-05/D-06 sealing, opening, decision-signing and
 * cursor-retry seam BOTH P2P transports (`p2p-registration-transport.ts`,
 * `p2p-association-transport.ts`) build on.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * D-03: NO PLAINTEXT FALLBACK, EVER.
 * ============================================================================
 * Every staged payload this seam's callers write onto a strand goes on as a 62-04 sealed
 * envelope, never as plaintext. A transport given no sealer refuses to stage at all
 * (`P2pStagingError 'no-sealer'`) before any I/O; a sealer that throws (e.g. a zero-recipient
 * seal) propagates that error unchanged and the caller writes zero rows. There is no code path
 * in this module, or in either transport that imports it, that writes an un-sealed payload
 * column.
 *
 * Every `P2pStagingError` message carries only a code and a call-site label — never a payload
 * value, a plaintext fragment, a registration code or an identity-field value. The opener's own
 * `detail` string (62-04/62-14's structural-only detail) is deliberately DROPPED wherever this
 * seam surfaces an opener failure — only the `reason` code crosses into a `StagingUnreadableRow`.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT IMPORT
 * ============================================================================
 * No P2P package (cadre-core, db-p2p, libp2p) and no filesystem module —
 * only `import type` reaches `../../crypto/index.js` (62-04's envelope types) and
 * `@votetorrent/vote-core` (`Signature`). The two transports supply their own `StagingSqlPort`
 * implementation (a `RegistrationStrandPort`/`AssociationStrandPort`, which is structurally wider
 * but satisfies this narrower shape); this module never opens a strand itself.

 * What the ceiling does and does not do:

 *      blocks allocation: `insertWithCursorRetry` walks past every occupied slot above it.
 *  (b) The staging report readers (`readConformingRows`) deliver EVERY conforming row, so a forged
 *      high cursor is re-reported on every read (consumers are idempotent, D-05) and never
 *      advances the high-water mark; an honest row that had to land above the ceiling is still
 *      delivered.
 *  (c) The decision readers (`readInSequenceRows`) still skip rows above the ceiling: consumers
 *      forward their notice cursors between polls, and only officers can write decision rows
 *      (D-06), so an officer-forged decision row delays later decisions until the row count
 *      catches up, but a forwarded cursor can never skip a later decision.
 *  (d) A non-conforming `sinceCursor` is treated as absent, so the caller re-reads from the start

 *
 * For attempt 1..`STAGING_CURSOR_MAX_ATTEMPTS`:
 *   1. Allocate the cursor (V-4): the greatest CONFORMING, IN-SEQUENCE cursor (at or below
 *      `stagingCursorCeiling`: row count + `STAGING_CURSOR_MAX_STEP`) is `base`; the candidate is
 *      max(`base`, `floor`) + 1, then WALKED upward past every occupied slot (ascending pages of
 *      64 rows), because the strand's (StrandId, Cursor) unique index refuses an occupied slot
 *      and re-deriving the same candidate would wedge allocation (CR-01). The walk pages by the
 *      last row seen (not by the candidate), so a page holding only non-conforming rows still
 *      advances; it is bounded to `STAGING_CURSOR_MAX_TEXT`, so above-cap and non-digit rows
 *      (which the decision tables' `CursorWidth` admits and pre-V-4 staging rows may carry) are
 *      never paged; a page that does not advance throws `cursor-exhausted`; cost grows by one
 *      query per 64 planted in-range rows (IN-05).
 *      `floor` is the slot a genuine race just took. Static occupied slots, however many a
 *      forger planted, never consume an attempt; only real concurrent inserts do. A malformed
 *      cursor is skipped. If the free slot is above the cap it throws `cursor-exhausted` without
 *      calling `mutate`. The bound is engine-side, not a schema CHECK: a self-referential CHECK
 *      is deferred and Quereus mis-evaluates batched deferred CHECKs.
 *   2. `port.mutate(insertSql, { ...params, cursor })`. On success, return
 *      `{ cursor, idempotent: false }`.
 *   3. On any rejection, first run the identity read (`args.identity`). If it returns rows, call
 *      `onIdentityConflict`: an `'idempotent'` result returns the EXISTING row's own cursor with
 *      `idempotent: true`; otherwise the returned `P2pStagingError` is thrown.
 *   4. Otherwise probe whether the allocated cursor is now taken
 *      (`select Cursor from <table> where StrandId = :strandId and Cursor = :cursor`). If taken,
 *      raise `floor` to it and continue to the next attempt (re-allocate past it).
 *   5. Otherwise the rejection is some OTHER schema refusal (a forged signature, a CHECK the row
 *      fails on its own merits) — throw `P2pStagingError('rejected', ...)` immediately, with the
 *      underlying error as `cause`.
 * After the loop (every attempt hit a genuine cursor race), throw
 * `P2pStagingError('cursor-exhausted', ...)`.
 *
 * No sleep and no randomness — the retry is deterministic, driven only by what the port reports.

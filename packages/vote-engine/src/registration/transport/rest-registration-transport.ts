/**
 * rest-registration-transport.ts — the D-01 pull-based REST binding,
 * `IRegistrationRequestTransport`'s SECOND real binding (the first is the
 * filesystem drop-file courier, `filesystem-registration-transport.ts`,
 * 48-09).
 *
 * **1. PULL BY DESIGN.** This binding only ever calls OUT. The authority
 * polls; it does not host an inbound webhook receiver, and it never binds a
 * port. `doc/registration.md:12`'s phrase "webhook/REST bridge" reads
 * naturally as "the authority receives inbound webhook POSTs" — that reading
 * is wrong here, and this comment states the correction explicitly so an
 * executor cannot arrive at the wrong reading by default: the phrase names a
 * *channel* (REST), not a *direction* (inbound). React Native cannot
 * reliably run a persistent background HTTP listener — there is no
 * long-running server process, the OS drives backgrounding and process-kill
 * semantics on its own schedule, and a NAT'd mobile device has no open
 * inbound port to defend in the first place. An inbound port on such a
 * device is additionally an attack surface with no way to close it.
 *
 * **2. Where a real push receiver would belong, if one is ever wanted:** a
 * small standalone Node service — this repo already has the precedent for
 * shipping infra tooling as its own package (`packages/p2p-probe-host`) —
 * never inside the app bundle. None is added in this phase.
 *
 * **3. Zero new dependencies.** This file uses only the Node/RN built-in
 * `fetch` and `AbortSignal.timeout`. Four HTTP-client packages are
 * deliberately absent and must stay absent: `axios`, `node-fetch`,
 * `express`, `fastify`. None of the four exists anywhere in this monorepo
 * today, and adding one for a single JSON round-trip is unwarranted — this
 * codebase has a documented aversion to new React Native bundling risk
 * (Phase 44's `@peculiar` device-boot wall cost two plans to unstick).
 *
 * **4. What makes a fetched document trustworthy here.** An `https://`
 * `baseUrl` is the expectation for any real deployment (`http://` is
 * acceptable only for a loopback test server); TLS protects confidentiality
 * and integrity **in transit** and authorizes NOTHING. The only thing that
 * makes a fetched request document trustworthy is the **requester's own
 * signature over the authority-issued digest**, which the schema's
 * `SignatureValid` CHECK verifies at INSERT (D-02). A binding that trusted
 * the endpoint instead of the signature would be trusting the network.
 * Certificate validation is the platform `fetch`'s; this file neither
 * disables nor overrides it.
 *
 * **5. The courier rule for `init.submittedAt`.** It is the submitter's own
 * signing-time timestamp and DG-1's seventh argument (48-02 L-3). This
 * binding forwards it **verbatim**: it never generates, defaults,
 * normalises, re-formats, or adopts a server-supplied replacement for it,
 * and it treats the digest handshake's echoed `submittedAt` as a value to
 * *verify*, never a value to *use*. A courier that rewrote it would
 * invalidate a signature it never touched, and the failure would surface at
 * the authority's INSERT — a layer away from its cause. The authority's own
 * intake observation is the separate `ReceivedAt` column, which is inside no
 * digest and never crosses this wire in either direction.
 *
 * **6. The `SignatureOrCallback` property.** This binding receives a
 * completed `Signature` or a digest→`Signature` callback and NEVER a raw
 * private key, so a channel that crosses a network holds no key material
 * (D-01/D-19).
 *
 * **7.** This file touches no ceremony. No sentence here claims the `'vrg'`
 * scope is enforced anywhere.
 *
 * **The wire protocol (locked, mirrored by the test-only server in this
 * package's spec file):**
 *   - R-1 `POST {baseUrl}/registration-requests/digest` `{ init, requesterKey }`
 *     → `{ digest, submittedAt }` (`submittedAt` is an ECHO of `init.submittedAt`).
 *   - R-2 `POST {baseUrl}/registration-requests`
 *     `{ init, requesterKey, submittedAt: init.submittedAt, signature }` → `{ requestId }`.
 *   - R-3 `GET {baseUrl}/registration-decisions?since={cursor}` (param omitted
 *     entirely when there is no cursor) → `{ notices }`.

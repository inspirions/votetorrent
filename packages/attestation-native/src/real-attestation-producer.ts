 * Stable module-level Keystore alias.

 * CORRECTED 2026-08-24 — the previous rationale here ("D-13 requires a STABLE alias so
 * enrollment-change invalidation is detectable") was a non-sequitur and is removed. The ALIAS is
 * stable; the KEY UNDER IT IS NOT. `produce()` below calls native `produceAttestation`, which
 * routes to `KeyAttestationHelper.regenerateAttested` — and that function `deleteEntry`s this
 * alias and generates a brand-new key pair BEFORE it ever calls `initSign`. So the key that gets
 * signed with is always microseconds old, no biometric enrolment can invalidate it, and the
 * `KeyPermanentlyInvalidatedException` catch on that path is unreachable. Alias stability buys
 * nothing for invalidation detection.
 *
 * What the stable alias actually buys: one well-known slot, so a ceremony never strands an
 * orphaned key under a generated name, and so `exportPublicKeyCompressedHex` has a fixed address
 * to read the post-regeneration key back from.
 *
 * The security property this path actually provides is KEY NON-REUSE — no attested key survives
 * across ceremonies — which is stronger than detect-then-recover. Do not re-introduce an
 * invalidation-detection claim here. Full analysis:
 * `.planning/todos/pending/2026-08-03-attestation-d13-key-invalidation-leg.md`.
 *
 * (`setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment(true)` remains load-bearing for the AUTHORITY app's
 * persistent signing key, reached via `signWithDeviceKey`, which does NOT regenerate first — that
 * is D-24 leg 3, hardware-proven 2026-08-18.)

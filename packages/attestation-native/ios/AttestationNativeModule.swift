//
//  AttestationNativeModule.swift — iOS counterpart of the Android `AttestationNative` TurboModule.
//
//  STATUS: TYPECHECKS against the iOS 26.2 SDK (arm64-apple-ios15.1, exit 0). RUNTIME behaviour is
//  still UNPROVEN — App Attest returns `isSupported == false` on the Simulator, so every
//  Secure Enclave / App Attest / biometric claim below needs a physical iPhone. A clean typecheck
//  is not working attestation. See ../README.md for the remaining proof legs.
//
//  The one exception: the DER -> compact low-S signature conversion (SignatureEncoding.swift) is
//  pure byte manipulation and IS fully proven on the host — 17/17 against @noble/curves v2 vectors.
//
//  Mirrors the 5-method surface of
//  `packages/attestation-native/src/specs/NativeAttestation.ts` so the JS orchestration layer
//  (`real-attestation-producer.ts`) can stay platform-agnostic apart from the payload shape.
//
//  THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE FROM ANDROID (spike 080): Android's Keystore key both carries the
//  attestation cert chain AND signs votes. Apple's App Attest key can ONLY be used via
//  `generateAssertion` — it cannot sign arbitrary payloads. So this module manages TWO keys:
//
//    K_att  — the App Attest key. Attests once, then only ever produces assertions.
//    K_vote — a separate Secure Enclave P-256 key. Signs ballots. Has NO attestation of its own.
//
//  K_vote is bound to the attested identity by an ASSERTION over a clientDataHash that commits to
//  K_vote's public bytes. That cross-sign is the entire security argument; without it K_vote is an
//  unattested key and the attestation proves nothing about the thing doing the voting.

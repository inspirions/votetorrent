/**
 * Which Optimystic transactor a strand connection commits through — a choice of
 * storage engine, nothing more. See {@link StrandConnectionOptions.transactor}.
 *
 * Deliberately a closed union, and narrower than what Optimystic's
 * `collection-factory.ts` accepts: that factory also switches on `'mesh-test'`
 * (its production transactor stack over a one-node mock mesh) and falls through
 * to a host-registered custom transactor for any other name. Neither is offered
 * here — `composeStrand`'s node gate special-cases only `'test'`, so
 * `'mesh-test'` would get a real libp2p node it does not want, and nothing in
 * this repo registers a custom transactor. A closed union lets `parseConfig`
 * reject a typo (`'locl'`) instead of handing it downstream; widen it (and the
 * node gate with it) when one of those values is actually needed.

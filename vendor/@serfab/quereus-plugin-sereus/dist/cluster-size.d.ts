/**
 * How long ONE cohort peer gets to answer ONE read-path request, in milliseconds — both
 * networks' `clusterPolicy.cohortQueryTimeoutMs`. It sets the latest-revision query a read

 * archive fetch that follows it (`fetchArchiveFromPeer`); Optimystic ties the two to one
 * field because they are the same round trip to the same peer. Optimystic's own default is
 * 1000 ms, a LAN-shaped budget, and it deliberately left that default alone — choosing the
 * value for a deployment of phones is the embedder's job.
 *
 * **Why 7000: it is a derivation, written out.** One read-path request opens a fresh protocol
 * stream over a connection that is already open, which costs the protocol negotiation plus the
 * request and its answer: two link round trips, `CIRCUIT_REQUEST_ROUND_TRIPS` in cadre-core's
 * `link-budget.ts`. At the link round trip cadre declares by default,
 * `DECLARED_LINK_ROUND_TRIP_MS` (3 500 ms, covering the 3-second relayed round trip sereus
 * supports), that is 2 x 3 500 = 7 000 ms — `cohortReadDeadlineMs()` in that module. This
 * constant must equal it, and `cadre-core/test/link-budget.spec.ts` pins the two equal; it is
 * spelled as a number here only because this package cannot import cadre-core (the dependency
 * runs the other way). A host that declares its own link (`NetworkConfig.linkRoundTripMs`)
 * gets the derivation at that link instead of this constant, and a host that sets
 * `NetworkConfig.cohortQueryTimeoutMs` gets exactly what it set. No admission allowance is
 * added: a read runs over an open connection and opens none. The whole-pass reconcile bound
 * Optimystic derives from it (`max(5000, 5 x this)`) becomes 35 s.
 *
 * **History: why 5000 before, and why it was not enough.** Optimystic GitHub #22, reported by
 * a sereus-based chat app: two parties that reach each other only through a public circuit
 * relay have a round trip near 1.8 s, and a fresh stream (dial or reuse, protocol select, send,
 * receive) cannot finish inside a second. At a cohort of two there is exactly one peer to ask,
 * so one late answer leaves the read with nothing to corroborate against and it is declined.
 * 5000 was chosen to cover 1.8 s with room for the Noise handshake, the relay hops and a
 * phone's pure-JS crypto (cadre-core's `NetworkConfig.noiseCrypto`), and it is the value
 * Optimystic's own note advises for that link. But sereus supports a 3 s round trip, and two
 * round trips of pure delay at that link is 6 s: above 5 000, so at the supported link every
 * consult timed out and every read had nothing to corroborate against — the #22 failure again,
 * one band up. The derivation ends that class: the next person to widen the link changes one
 * declaration.
 *
 * **Measured at 5000**, 2026-09-26, one Windows developer machine, two relay-only `CadreNode`s
 * on one shared loopback dedicated relay, the one-way outbound frame delay raised to 900 ms
 * (`pipelined` mode — see `docs/testing.md` → "Where measurements live") AFTER the strand had
 * formed and first synced, for a round trip near 1.8 s. A machine that had joined, gone away
 * while the other wrote, then re-attached over its own stale store and read the row written
 * while it was away. Declined reads over that journey, after the delay was raised: **18 at
 * Optimystic's 1000 ms, 2 at 5000 ms.** A declined read is
 * `cluster-fetch:peers-silent { silent: 1, consulted: 2 }` followed by
 * `cluster-fetch:no-quorum`, retried about a second later until one lands; at 5000 the
 * corroboration succeeded instead (`cluster-fetch:local-current`). Both journeys COMPLETED at
 * either value, which is why no committed scenario gates this — 900 ms is not where it breaks.
 * The recipe for re-measuring is in `docs/testing.md` → "Where measurements live".
 *
 * **Measured at 7000 against 5000**, 2026-09-29, same machine and shape, at 1 500 ms one-way
 * (the supported 3 s round trip), fresh-join arm, one run each under
 * `DEBUG=optimystic:db-p2p:coordinator-repo*`: **39 declined reads at 5000, 32 at 7000**, both
 * runs completing (writable at 70.2 s and 63.6 s). That difference is noise, not the deadline
 * at work: in both runs every consult on the joiner ended 3.00-3.02 s after the one before
 * it, the signature of Optimystic's fixed 3 000 ms request dial deadline
 * (`DEFAULT_DIAL_TIMEOUT_MS`), which its `openProtocolStream` forwards into `newStream` on an
 * ALREADY-OPEN connection, where the protocol negotiation alone costs one link round trip —
 * 3 s at this delay. So at the supported link neither 5000 nor 7000 is ever reached; every
 * consult is cut off first, and the join completes because peer-join backfill delivers the
 * blocks and the first-sync gate probes until it holds them. The derivation is right and
 * stays: it is the deadline a consult needs once it is allowed to run, and the 1.8 s-band
 * figures above (18 declined at 1000, 2 at 5000, where the negotiation fits inside 3 s) are
 * what show a per-peer deadline doing its work. Until the upstream dial deadline moves, no
 * value of this constant changes the count at 1 500 ms one-way:
 * `tickets/blocked/report-request-dial-deadline-cuts-cohort-consults-on-open-connections-to-optimystic`.
 * The first-sync figures from the same runs are on `DEFAULT_STRAND_FIRST_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS`.
 *
 * **What it costs**, in the terms Optimystic's own field doc uses: a peer that is truly gone
 * now holds a read of a block missing locally for up to 7 s before the read is declined
 * instead of 5 s (1 s at Optimystic's default). A joining machine's first sync runs several
 * such consults, so it is the cost that binds — and the first-sync band measured at each
 * deadline, against the budget it has to fit, is recorded once, on
 * `DEFAULT_STRAND_FIRST_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS` in cadre-core's `strand-first-sync-gate.ts`. At 5000
 * against the 30 s budget that once preceded it, that change alone would have turned a
 * slow-but-working join into the very `StrandAwaitingFirstSyncError` the report named.
 *
 * **What else it lengthens.** Every cadre-core deadline that waits on an Optimystic read or
 * commit waits on this one too; which of them cut the read off on purpose and which must
 * outlast it is listed in `docs/cadre-consistency.md` → "Deadlines Over Optimystic's Reads and
 * Commits".
 *
 * **One value for both networks, not two.** The reason to widen is the link, and a phone's
 * control node and its strand nodes share it; nothing about control traffic or strand traffic
 * argues for different numbers. A host that needs another value moves both at once —
 * cadre-core's `NetworkConfig.cohortQueryTimeoutMs` or `NetworkConfig.linkRoundTripMs`,
 * threaded to {@link controlClusterPolicy} and {@link strandClusterPolicy} through one helper
 * (`declaredCohortReadDeadlineMs` in cadre-core's `link-budget.ts`).
 *
 * NOTE: this number and the first-sync budget are coupled; the margin between that budget and
 * the slowest first sync measured is stated on it. Re-measure the first-sync band before
 * raising the declared link round trip, or when a deployment's first sync grows more
 * collections than the two-table scenario measured above — `DEFAULT_STRAND_FIRST_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS`
 * carries the result and `docs/testing.md` the recipe.
 * Nothing warns when the margin goes; the symptom is `StrandAwaitingFirstSyncError` on a join
 * that was progressing normally, which is the failure this pair of numbers exists to end.

/**
 * How many nodes each block of the **control** (cadre membership) database is replicated
 * to. Chosen to exceed any party's node count, so in practice every control block lands
 * on every member of the party. Cohort width alone only delivers that for blocks written
 * while the members were serving the network: a block committed while the writer was
 * alone (the founder's genesis above all — collection headers are written once and never
 * revised) has a cohort of one, and it reaches later joiners through cadre-core's
 * peer-join block catch-up (`peer-join-backfill.ts`, membership-gated on the control
 * network), not through this breadth.
 *
 * **Why full replication here.** Every control node reads the whole control database —
 * membership, peer addresses, the strand list — so a member left out of a block's cohort is
 * a member that may never learn the fact, and at a cohort of two the *read repair* that is
 * supposed to make that safe cannot converge (it can ask exactly one peer, and that peer may
 * be the member that also missed the write). Measured: 4 failures in 10 runs of the
 * control-DB replication scenario at size 2, 0 in 20 at size 3 and 0 in 10 at size 8.
 *
 * **Why this number, and why a constant.** Optimystic caps a cohort at the peers that
 * actually serve the network and downsizes a cohort it cannot fill (`allowDownsize: true`,
 * which Cadre passes), so any value at or above the party's node count yields the same
 * behaviour: cohort = whole party. 16 is roughly twice the largest deployment the product
 * documents (`docs/architecture.md` → "Enterprise (Multi-Node Mixed)", 7 nodes) — headroom
 * without pretending to support arbitrarily large parties; a party genuinely running more
 * than 16 nodes is back to partial replication for its control database and should raise
 * this. It is a constant rather than the live member count because Optimystic freezes the
 * value at libp2p-node construction, before the `ControlDatabase` holding the `CadrePeer`
 * rows exists, and because a per-node derivation lets two members disagree.
 *
 * A cadre is one party by construction, so the owner-blind cohort-selection question that
 * applies to strand networks (see {@link DEFAULT_STRAND_CLUSTER_SIZE} below) is not a question
 * here: "replicate to the whole party" already is the whole intent, and there is no party
 * diversity for this breadth to buy or fail to buy.
 *
 * Canonical explanation of all of the above — the read-repair mechanics, what whole-party
 * breadth does and does not remove, and what the wider cohort costs in write availability —
 * is `docs/architecture.md` → "Replication cluster size". Keep it there, not here.
 *
 * **Deliberately not `clusterPolicy.assumedClusterSize`.** That option means "the smallest
 * cohort this deployment can genuinely field", and it feeds both the membership admission
 * gate's low-confidence path *and* the read-repair/reconcile corroboration floor. A Cadre
 * party legitimately runs one or two nodes, so Cadre leaves it at Optimystic's default of 2;
 * asserting 16 there would make the admission gate demand `ceil(0.75 x 16) = 12` declared
 * peers and refuse every real party's writes.
 *
 * NOTE: cohort selection overfetches proportionally to this number —
 * `Libp2pKeyPeerNetwork.membershipOverfetch` asks FRET for
 * `max(clusterSize * 4, clusterSize + 16)` candidates and does a peerStore protocol lookup
 * per candidate, so 16 requests a 64-peer proximity band. Free today, because the result is
 * bounded by the peers FRET actually knows (2 in a 3-node party). If control-network cohort
 * selection ever shows up as slow on a large mesh, look here first.

 * the two cannot drift: the object literal used to be hand-copied at both sites, and the copy
 * at the harness had picked up a `superMajorityThreshold` override production never had.
 *
 * `superMajorityThreshold` is deliberately ABSENT. Omitting it makes both the cluster member
 * and the coordinator fall back to Optimystic's `DEFAULT_SUPER_MAJORITY_THRESHOLD` (0.75) —
 * the bar a real party commits control writes against. Setting it here, or at any one
 * consumer, reintroduces exactly the divergence this constant exists to prevent. The absence
 * is a researched decision, not an inherited default: no threshold both relaxes the
 * three-node unanimity bar and satisfies Optimystic's partition-safety condition at the
 * shipped admission fraction — see `docs/architecture.md` → "Replication cluster size".
 *
 * `sizeTolerance` only makes sense alongside `allowDownsize`: a fixed
 * {@link CONTROL_REPLICATION_BREADTH}-wide target is unsatisfiable by any real (2-7 node)
 * party, so the cohort must be allowed to shrink to the party that actually exists.
 *
 * NOT for strand networks: {@link STRAND_CLUSTER_POLICY} is a structurally identical object
 * for a different network with different reasoning. The shape match is a coincidence; keep
 * them separate.
 *
 * `assumedClusterSize` is REQUIRED here, and 2 is not a guess — it is the smallest party we
 * support. The field feeds two Optimystic consumers with opposite failure modes, and only one
 * of them defaults to something workable for us:
 *
 * - The membership admission gate already defaults to 2 (`minAbsoluteClusterSize`), so naming
 *   it changes nothing there.
 * - The read-repair / reconcile corroboration floor does NOT. Absent this field it falls back
 *   to `clusterSize` — which for the control network is {@link CONTROL_REPLICATION_BREADTH},
 *   16. `corroboratorCapacity(peers, 16)` is then `max(peers, 15)`, so the floor of two
 *   distinct non-self corroborators binds. A two-node party fields exactly one, can never
 *   reach two, and so can never repair a block: `cluster-fetch:no-quorum` forever.
 *
 * Declaring 2 does NOT lower the replication factor — that stays at
 * {@link CONTROL_REPLICATION_BREADTH}. It states the cohort size we can genuinely field, which
 * is what the corroboration floor is asking. See Optimystic's `cluster/cluster-policy.ts`
 * ("Why two size yardsticks, not one") and `corroboratorCapacity` in `cluster/quorum-restore.ts`.
 *
 * **`assumedClusterSize` is now the ADMISSION yardstick.** Since Optimystic grew
 * `repairCorroborationClusterSize` (see {@link controlClusterPolicy}), the repair corroboration
 * floor prefers that separate declaration and reads this field only when nothing was declared —
 * the unknown-machine-count path, where the paragraph above still describes what it does. So on
 * every path where the count IS known, the 2 here governs one consumer: the membership admission
 * gate's low-confidence fallback path. Leaving
 * it at 2 is deliberate and must NOT be "fixed" to match the repair yardstick. Raising it would
 * make the gate demand `ceil(0.75 x N)` DECLARED peers before it admits a coordinator's peer
 * set on that path, and a Cadre party is phones and laptops: it cannot promise that three
 * quarters of its enrolled machines are awake at any moment, so a party of eight with three
 * awake would stop transacting entirely. The repair yardstick has no such cost (it gates only
 * whether this node believes a repair answer), which is exactly why the two are now separate
 * numbers rather than one.
 *
 * `cohortQueryTimeoutMs` is declared for the same reason it is declared on the strand policy —
 * the link, not the network ({@link COHORT_READ_DEADLINE_MS}). Absent it, Optimystic's LAN-shaped
 * 1000 ms would leave a control read over a relayed link with no corroborating answer in time.
 *
 * The `satisfies` is load-bearing: without it a mistyped or obsolete key would compile at both
 * this definition and every consumer, because TypeScript only excess-property-checks fresh
 * object literals, not a shared constant handed to `clusterPolicy`.

 *
 * Four is the smallest breadth that lets a write commit while one holder is away. At two or
 * three every holder must be awake for every write, which for a workspace shared between
 * phones and laptops is the ordinary case, not the rare one. Six buys no more fault tolerance
 * than four and costs more overfetch (see the NOTE below).
 *
 * **Exercised at four machines** by `integration-tests`'
 * `scenarios/strand-two-party-two-machine.integration.ts`, the only scenario that runs a
 * strand at this breadth. It shows a write committing while one of the four machines is off.
 * It does NOT distinguish that from a commit on a cohort downsized to the three live holders
 * (`allowDownsize` in {@link STRAND_CLUSTER_POLICY}), so the table row above remains reasoned
 * arithmetic with an end-to-end existence proof under it, not a measurement of cohort width.
 *
 * **It is also a correctness floor, not only a durability one — but the floor is measured in
 * machines, not in this number.** A node that has fallen behind and can ask exactly one peer
 * whether it is current has Optimystic accept that single answer as the cluster's truth
 * (`corroboratorCapacity` in `db-p2p/src/cluster/quorum-restore.ts` lowers the corroboration
 * floor to one when the cohort cannot hold a second voter). If that peer is also behind it
 * honestly reports the stale revision, the reader concludes it is current, and re-arms its
 * repair window forever. Measured on the control-DB replication scenario: 4 failures in 10 runs
 * at breadth 2, 0 in 20 at breadth 3, 0 in 10 at breadth 8. What lifts the floor off a single
 * voter is a third machine **or a declaration that there are three** — not a wider target.
 * `corroboratorCapacity` takes the max of the cohort peers actually present and the declared
 * repair yardstick, so raising *this* number (the replication breadth) does nothing: the
 * yardstick is a separate declaration, and **a strand node makes no such declaration today**.
 * The control network derives one from the party's enrolled machines
 * ({@link controlClusterPolicy}), which is exact there because every enrolled machine runs the
 * control node. A strand has no equivalent count: it launches only on machines whose embedder
 * registered its sApp config, plus storage-profile machines that host unclaimed strands as
 * storage replicas (cadre-core's `CadreNodeConfig.hostUnclaimedStrands`) and whose strand filter
 * admits it. Phones serve only what their app claims, so reusing the party count over-declares, which is worse than
 * declaring nothing, because at a yardstick of three or more the corroboration floor is pinned
 * at two peers and a strand that can field only one could then never repair at all. So every
 * strand runs {@link STRAND_CLUSTER_POLICY} unchanged and takes the single-voter exposure
 * whenever its cohort view shrinks to one peer. The underlying Optimystic behaviour is unfixed
 * (`backlog/debt-read-repair-single-voter-corroboration`) and the per-strand serving count that
 * would let a strand declare honestly is `backlog/feat-strand-yardstick-from-serving-machines`
 * — its seam ({@link strandClusterPolicy}'s `servingMachines`, threaded through
 * `StartStrandConfig.servingMachines`) is already in place and fed by nothing. Raising this
 * number does not buy the way out; a machine, or an honest declaration of the machines actually
 * serving the strand, does.
 *
 * **Why not derived from the party or member count.** The strand's `Member` rows live *in* the
 * strand database, which runs on the strand libp2p node, whose cluster size is frozen at
 * construction — reading the list to configure the node needs the node to exist. Open strands
 * have no member list at all. The count also changes in the unsafe direction: a node that
 * restarted after someone joined derives a wider expected cohort than one that did not, and the
 * membership admission gate's confident path is what rejects the *wider* view. And a `Member` is
 * a party, not a machine; cohort width consumes machines. Full reasoning in
 * `docs/architecture.md` → "Replication cluster size".
 *
 * **Four machines, not four parties.** This number counts machines, and today that is not the
 * same as counting independent holders. Cohort selection upstream is owner-blind — it
 * picks nodes by hash proximity with no concept of which peer belongs to which party
 * (`optimystic/tickets/backlog/feat-cohort-selection-owner-aware-placement`) — and on the
 * cadre-driven path, the one that resolves a seed for itself, a strand's libp2p mesh is seeded
 * from exactly one party's own control-database peer rows (`CadreNode.resolveCohortSeed`), so
 * the cohort actually formed is that one party's machines. Four copies are, on that path, four
 * machines belonging to one party — one failure domain, one witness. A cross-party mesh has
 * exactly one automatic path — a formation result carries the responder's strand addresses and
 * `CadreNode.resolveCohortSeed` unions them in, seeding only the pair that just redeemed an
 * invitation — and is otherwise hand-supplied addresses
 * (`StrandConnectionOptions.bootstrapNodes`) or a hand-written dial (see the doc). Every party
 * now holds its own membership identity, so the missing piece is placement, not identity:
 * tracked as `backlog/feat-strand-party-diverse-placement`. Full reasoning:
 * `docs/architecture.md` → "Replication cluster size".
 *
 * Raising or lowering it per strand is still the embedder's call
 * ({@link resolveStrandClusterSize}, `CadreNodeConfig.strandClusterSize`,
 * `StrandConnectionOptions.clusterSize`) — but every node on one strand must agree, so a change
 * means restarting all of them. There is no smaller-than-{@link MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE} option.
 *
 * NOTE: cohort selection overfetches proportionally — `Libp2pKeyPeerNetwork.membershipOverfetch`
 * asks FRET for `max(clusterSize * 4, clusterSize + 16)` candidates and does one peerStore
 * protocol lookup per candidate, so 4 requests a 20-peer band (was 18 at breadth 2). Negligible,
 * and bounded by the peers FRET actually knows. If strand cohort selection ever shows up as slow,

 * - **Repair corroboration floor** (`corroboratorCapacity` / `quorumSize` in
 *   `db-p2p/src/cluster/quorum-restore.ts`): capacity is `max(p, N - 1)` and the floor is
 *   `max(1, min(2, capacity))`. So `N = 1` and `N = 2` behave IDENTICALLY at every `p` — both
 *   leave the floor at a single voter whenever `p <= 1`. `N >= 3` pins the floor at two
 *   corroborators unconditionally, including when the view has shrunk to one peer. That is the
 *   entire point of declaring. `N` above 3 raises nothing further (the `min(2, ...)` caps it), so
 *   a larger declaration buys only honesty, never more repair.
 * - **Commit freshness window** (`CoordinatorRepo.commitQuorumRulesOutRivals`): `fullCohortSize`
 *   is `max(observed cohort, N)`, and a local commit arms the lazy read-repair window only when
 *   `approvals > fullCohortSize / 2`. Here a larger `N` is NOT free — see the NOTE below.
 * - The `repair-fault-tolerance` startup advisory — log text only.
 *
 * Hence `max(MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE, min(servingMachines, replicationBreadth))`, two clamps each for
 * a stated reason:
 *
 * - **Capped at the replication breadth**, because a block only ever lives on
 *   `min(breadth, machines serving)` machines. A party of eight running strands at
 *   {@link DEFAULT_STRAND_CLUSTER_SIZE} has a cohort of four; declaring eight would make
 *   `approvals > 4` unsatisfiable (a super-majority of four is three), so the freshness window
 *   would never arm for any strand commit, forever — and buy nothing on repair, whose floor is
 *   already at its cap at four. Declare the machines that can hold the block, not the machines
 *   that exist.
 * - **Floored at {@link MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE}**, so this can only ever RAISE the declared number
 *   relative to the un-derived constants. A node that authorizes nobody is a genuine
 *   founder-alone party, but it is equally a freshly seeded node whose membership rows have not
 *   replicated yet, or one whose trusted-owner anchor is empty — and this node cannot tell those
 *   apart. Declaring 1 is safety-neutral for repair (identical to 2 at every `p`, per the table
 *   above) but it WOULD let a solo commit arm the freshness window, which is wrong if the "solo"
 *   reading came from stale local records. Lifting that floor for a node that can prove it is
 *   genuinely alone is separate work: `backlog/feat-solo-node-arms-its-own-freshness-window`.
 *
 * The yardstick is per-node and protects only that node's own reads — no node refuses another
 * anything over it — so two members disagreeing (one has replicated a new `CadrePeer` row, one
 * has not) is harmless by construction, not a race to close.
 *
 * ## The contract: callers pass machines that SERVE this network, or nothing at all
 *
 * Over-declaring is not merely wasteful, it is unsafe in the availability direction: at
 * `N >= 3` the corroboration floor is pinned at two peers, so a cohort that can only ever
 * field one peer can never repair at all (`cluster-fetch:no-quorum`), where a declaration of
 * 2 would have let its single peer answer. So the number a caller passes must be the machines
 * that actually serve the network in question — never a broader population that merely bounds
 * it from above, and never a guess. A caller with no trustworthy count passes nothing, which
 * the builders below turn into "declare no yardstick at all".
 *
 * The CONTROL network satisfies this from the party's enrolled machines, because every enrolled
 * machine runs the control node by construction: there, enrolled IS serving
 * ({@link controlClusterPolicy}, fed by cadre-core's `enrolled-machine-store.ts`). A STRAND does
 * not — it launches only on machines whose embedder registered its sApp config
 * (`CadreNode.addStrand`), plus storage-profile machines hosting it as a storage replica
 * (`CadreNodeConfig.hostUnclaimedStrands`) whose strand filter admits it. A closed strand
 * claimed by two phones of a three-phone party is served by two, and declaring three would be
 * exactly the unsafe over-declaration above. No
 * authenticated per-strand serving count exists yet, so strand nodes declare NOTHING and run the
 * frozen {@link STRAND_CLUSTER_POLICY} — keeping the known, upstream-tracked single-voter
 * exposure (`backlog/debt-read-repair-single-voter-corroboration`) rather than risking the
 * cannot-repair-at-all failure. Building that count:
 * `backlog/feat-strand-yardstick-from-serving-machines`.
 *
 * Both arguments must be positive integers; the builders below sanitize before calling, and
 * a degenerate value here propagates (`NaN` in, `NaN` out) rather than being clamped.
 *
 * NOTE: on a party of three or more machines where fewer than half are awake, a commit reaches a
 * downsized cohort and no longer arms the freshness window, so each such block's next read costs
 * one cohort consult per read-repair window instead of trusting the local commit. That is the
 * correct reading of the honest number — a commit that reached two of five machines genuinely
 * does not rule out a rival quorum, and arming it today is a consequence of under-declaring — and
 * the cost is bounded at one consult per block per window by the read path's solo-self-skip exit.
 * NOT measured under load. If a large, mostly-hibernating party's read path ever shows up as
 * slow, this is the first thing to look at.

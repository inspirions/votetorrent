/**
 * Embedded strand membership/RBAC schema for cross-platform compatibility.
 *
 * This is the authoritative runtime copy of the `Strand` membership schema. It
 * is duplicated from `schemas/strand.qsql` so that React Native and other
 * filesystem-less environments get the schema without a runtime file read —
 * the same pattern `CONTROL_SCHEMA` (cadre-core) uses for the control schema.
 *
 * `STRAND_SCHEMA` holds only the *body* (the inner table declarations). The
 * shared composition (`composeStrand`) wraps it in
 * `declare schema Strand { ... } apply schema Strand;`, mirroring how the sApp
 * schema is wrapped in `declare schema App { ... }`.
 *
 * Drift discipline: the table declarations here MUST stay byte-equivalent to the
 * body of `schemas/strand.qsql` (the on-disk canonical copy). Any edit here must
 * be mirrored there and vice versa. `test/strand-schema-drift.spec.ts` enforces it
 * — but only from THIS package, so an edit made in `schemas/strand.qsql` alone
 * stays green everywhere its author is likely to look; run that spec after either.
 *
 * Crypto idiom (matches `schemas/control.qsql` and the sApp RBAC fixture
 * `packages/integration-tests/fixtures/simple-sapp.qsql`): every signed write
 * proves itself with `verify(digest(<single joined payload>),
 * <signature>, <pubkey>, 'ed25519')`. Member keys are ed25519, so the explicit
 * curve arg is REQUIRED (verify() otherwise defaults to secp256k1).
 *
 * Population note: this ticket applies the schema and makes its constraints
 * active — it does NOT write membership rows at runtime. Inserting the `Header`,
 * the founding `Manager`/`Member`, and the invite/peer flows is owned by
 * `strand-membership-lifecycle-population`.

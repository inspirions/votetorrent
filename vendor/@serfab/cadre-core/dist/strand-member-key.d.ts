 *
 * The founding `Member.Key`/`Manager.MemberKey` (the strand RBAC layer) are the
 * `publicKeyB64` of the keypair this returns, derived from the PARTY's own
 * `StrandPartyKey.PrivateKey` — deliberately NOT from the strand row's
 * `MemberPrivateKey`, which is the strand-wide read secret every joining party
 * receives (an identity derived from it is one every joiner can forge —
 * gotchoices/sereus#4). Both keys share this encoding, so this decoder serves
 * either. Decode the protobuf to a libp2p private key, then reuse
 * {@link ed25519KeyPairFromLibp2p} so the same seed→public derivation used for node
 * owner keys yields a stable `{ privateKeyB64, publicKeyB64 }` whose public
 * key a later strand signature verifies against.
 *
 * @param memberPrivateKey - A strand membership private key (base64 protobuf).

 * @throws If the decoded key is not Ed25519 or the raw bytes are malformed.

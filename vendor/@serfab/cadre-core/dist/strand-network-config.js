/**
 * Derive the per-STRAND-node view of the machine's one `NetworkConfig`.
 *
 * A cadre machine runs one **control** libp2p node plus one more libp2p node per
 * strand, and every one of them is built from the SAME operator-written
 * `NetworkConfig` block. Two of its fields describe a single endpoint on the host
 * and therefore cannot be inherited literally by a second node on that host:
 *
 * - **`listenAddrs` with a fixed port.** `cadre-cli`'s example config ships
 *   `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4001`. The control node binds it first; every strand node
 *   then tries to bind the same port and fails with `EADDRINUSE`, so a machine
 *   configured with a fixed port could not start any strand at all.
 * - **`announceAddrs` / `appendAnnounceAddrs`.** Any concrete announce entry names
 *   a port, and that port is the CONTROL node's. A strand node advertising it
 *   sends peers to the control node — and `announceAddrs` REPLACES the advertised
 *   set (see `announce-addrs.ts`), so that wrong address would be the ONLY thing
 *   the strand node publishes.
 *
 * The reachability model this rests on: **a strand node is not separately dialable
 * at a published fixed address.** It is reached through (a) its ephemeral direct
 * listener plus the addresses peers observe for it, and (b) circuit relay —
 * `network.relayAddrs` resolves to ONE bare `/p2p-circuit` SEARCH listen entry PER
 * relay, and the strand runtime (`strand-instance-manager.ts`) runs one
 * reservation supervisor per relay over the dial addrs this module returns beside
 * them ({@link StrandNodeAddrs.relayAddrs}). The same route the control node takes,
 * for the same reason the configured `<relay>/p2p-circuit` shape was retired
 * everywhere (`relay-addrs.ts`): a configured listener loses its address on a relay
 * restart, on either side hanging up, and on libp2p's own reservation refresh, and
 * recovers from none of them. One search entry per relay rather than one for all,
 * because a search listener registers exactly ONE pending reservation and libp2p
 * fills a pending reservation with exactly one relay — so N relays need N listeners,
 * each with a supervisor that owns it.
 *
 * A hand-written `<relay>/p2p-circuit` entry in `listenAddrs` counts as a relay
 * (its dial prefix is supervised like a `relayAddrs` entry) — the control node
 * rejects that entry outright, so in production it never reaches here, but a
 * strand built straight from such a config must not get an unsupervised configured
 * listener either. A hand-written BARE `/p2p-circuit` (the browser shape,
 * `reference-app-web`) passes through unchanged when no relay is named, and is
 * absorbed by the per-relay entries when one is.
 *
 * Everything else in `NetworkConfig` — `transports`, `noiseCrypto`, `connectionMonitor`,
 * `cohortQueryTimeoutMs`, `connectionGater`, `enableRelay` — is inherited by the caller; this
 * module only owns the two host-endpoint fields above and the relay listen shape. One caveat on
 * `connectionGater`: an OPEN strand's node gets it unchanged, while a CLOSED strand's
 * node composes revoked-peer denial onto it in `strand-instance-manager.ts` (every
 * supplied hook still honored — see `strand-revocation-enforcer.ts`).
 *
 * It does carry one non-address option out with them: the WebSocket transport switch
 * a `/ws` listen entry implies (`relay-addrs.ts` → `resolveTransportOptions`). That is
 * DERIVED from the listen entries rather than inherited, so it has to be computed
 * wherever they are, and a strand node whose listen entries reached libp2p without it
 * would bind no WebSocket listener and report nothing.

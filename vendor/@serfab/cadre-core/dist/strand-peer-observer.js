/**
 * The strand peer book's OBSERVATION writer: on one strand libp2p node, every peer
 * whose identify result names this strand's block-transfer protocol — a strand peer,
 * never the circuit relay or a bootstrap node ({@link speaksBlockTransfer}, the
 * same gate `PeerJoinBackfill` schedules on) — is reported with its dialable
 * addresses, so `CadreNode` can merge an unsigned book entry for it
 * (`strand-peer-book.ts`). That is what lets a restarted machine dial the peers it
 * was talking to, instead of only the ones a formation once carried back.
 *
 * Dialable addresses are the peer's announced `listenAddrs` from the identify
 * result, plus the open connection's `remoteAddr` when it is relayed
 * (`/p2p-circuit`) — a relay-only peer announces its circuit listener, but the
 * address this node actually reached it on is the one proven to work. Every
 * address is bound to the peer id (`withTrailingPeerId`), ordered signaling-first
 * and capped like a formation's list, so the book files it under the right peer.
 *
 * Throttled to one report per peer per {@link STRAND_PEER_OBSERVE_THROTTLE_MS}
 * unless the address set changed, so a flapping relayed connection — identify
 * fires on every reconnect, every 16 s at worst — does not rewrite the node-local
 * slot each time. Best-effort throughout: nothing here throws into a libp2p event
 * handler.
 *
 * Lifecycle: one observer per running strand, armed in
 * `StrandInstanceManager.buildStrandRuntime` right after the libp2p node exists
 * (the bootstrap dials that follow `libp2p.start()` are exactly the peers worth
 * observing) and stopped in `releaseRuntime`, so a hibernation wake re-arms it on
 * the rebuilt node. `start` also walks the peers already connected, because
 * identify may have completed for an early peer before this object existed.

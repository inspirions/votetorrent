/**
 * Node-only file-backed {@link TrustedOwnerStore}: one JSON file per party under
 * a configured directory (the node's state directory — `cadre-cli` passes
 * `ResolvedConfig.nodeStateDir`), holding the node-local, non-replicated
 * trusted-owner anchor.
 *
 * Nothing but the file itself lives here: the anchor's envelope, load policy,
 * per-entry validation and serialised snapshot writes are cross-platform in
 * `PersistentTrustedOwnerStore` / `node-local-snapshot.ts`, and the file is a
 * `FileDurableSlot`. This module exists only so the `node:fs` edge stays out of
 * the package's cross-platform default entry (`./index.js`) — import it from
 * the dedicated subpath instead:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { FileTrustedOwnerStore } from '@serfab/cadre-core/trusted-owner-store-file';
 * ```
 *
 * A React Native / browser entry graph never resolves this path, so the
 * `node:fs` edge never reaches a bundler that cannot satisfy it (same
 * isolation pattern as `key-store-file.ts`).

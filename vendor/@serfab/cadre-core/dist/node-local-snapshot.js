/**
 * Shared machinery for the node's **node-local** records — the small,
 * NEVER-replicated, per-party sets a node keeps for itself and never sources
 * from shared group state:
 *
 *  - the trusted-owner anchor (`trusted-owner-store.ts`),
 *  - the cold-start bootstrap-peer store (`bootstrap-peer-store.ts`),
 *  - the strand peer book (`strand-peer-book.ts`), whose entries are one map per
 *    strand rather than one value per key — the validation hook below is what
 *    lets it drop a single junk peer without dropping the strand.
 *
 * ANOTHER node-local record — the enrolled-machine count
 * (`enrolled-machine-store.ts`) — reuses {@link DurableSlot} but deliberately
 * NOT this module's snapshot machinery: it is one scalar rather than an entry
 * map, and it must cold-start rather than throw on an unreadable slot. Its
 * module comment carries the reasoning; do not fold it in here.
 *
 * Every record here is the same mechanism with a different payload: a
 * `{ version, partyId, <entries> }` envelope, snapshot-written whole on every
 * change, loaded under one fail-safe-but-not-fail-silent policy. The only part
 * that differs per platform is WHERE the bytes are kept — Node writes a file,
 * a browser writes IndexedDB, React Native writes SecureStore or its LevelDB
 * KV, NativeScript writes SQLite. That difference is the whole of
 * {@link DurableSlot}, which the embedding app supplies; everything else lives
 * here.
 *
 * This module is cross-platform (no `node:` imports), so it is safe in the
 * package's default entry — the Node-only `FileDurableSlot`
 * (`file-durable-slot.ts`) is what stays behind the `*-store-file` subpaths.

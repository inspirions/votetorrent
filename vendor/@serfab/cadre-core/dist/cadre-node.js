     *     configured bootstrap/relay infrastructure);
     *  2. an enrollment window is open ({@link openEnrollmentWindow}, opened by
     *     {@link createInvite}) — the invitee dials in before it is authorized;
     *  3. the peer holds a live DELEGATE ADMISSION GRANT — an authorized member
     *     announced it (over the strand-addr RPC) as the transport peerId of its
     *     own strand node, so a NAT'd member's strand node can hold a
     *     circuit-relay reservation here (see `delegate-admission.ts`).
     *     Connection only: the per-stream gate below never honors a grant;
     *  4. the authorized-member set is empty — cold start: the rows that would
     *     authorize anyone arrive by replication over these very connections;
     *  5. the peer IS an authorized member; or
     *  6. an open invitation is OUTSTANDING — at least one unexpired,
     *     not-fully-consumed invitation this node minted or persisted (see
     *     `StrandSolicitationService.hasOutstandingInvitation`). A formation
     *     initiator is another party's peer by design and its token is only
     *     checkable inside the protocol, so the gate asks the coarser question
     *     "does this node expect a stranger at all?". Merely REGISTERING the
     *     responder ({@link initializeStrandSolicitation}) no longer suspends
     *     stranger denial — eager registration (as `reference-app-rn` does at
     *     bring-up) and `formStrand`'s lazy initialization both leave the gate
     *     armed, because neither mints an invitation.
     *
     * Ordering is semantically free (the checks are OR'd) but decides who pays:
     * checks 1-3 are in-memory, 4/5 share one control-DB read, and only a peer
     * already on the deny path reaches check 6's invitation lookup.
     *
     * Caveats of check 6, both self-healing:
     *  - the in-memory mint registry dies with the process, so after a restart
     *    only invitations persisted as `FormationInvite` rows still hold the
     *    exemption open (re-mint otherwise — same story as the enrollment window);
     *  - a peer holding a token whose `FormationInvite` row has not replicated to
     *    this node yet is denied even though the formation handler would have
     *    accepted it, exactly like the unreplicated-membership-row case below.
     *
     * When every check falls through, the verdict depends on whether this node
     * runs the circuit-relay server ({@link relayServer}): without one,
     * `'deny'`; with one, `'admit-for-relay'` — a circuit-relay reservation is
     * established by the reserving peer DIALING the relay, so a connection deny
     * here kills the reservation, and that deny is NOT self-healing: an outbound
     * reconcile re-dial re-establishes a data link, but no outbound dial can
     * grant the remote peer a reservation, and a relay-only peer has no address
     * of its own to dial back — the reservation IS its address. The gater admits
     * such a connection, decides the reservation via
     * {@link admitControlRelayReservation}, and drops the connection if no
     * reservation is admitted in time (see `membership-connection-gater.ts` →
     * "The relay-reservation seam").
     *
     * NOTE: check 4/5 runs a control-DB read per inbound connection
     * (`listAuthorizedMembers`); connections are rare and cadres small, and this
     * layer is fail-open behind `ADMISSION_DECISION_TIMEOUT_MS`, so the live
     * read is safe here — unlike the per-stream gate, which must consult the
     * materialized {@link authorizedControlPeers} snapshot instead.
     * NOTE: on a relay-DISABLED node, a sibling whose membership row has not yet
     * replicated here is denied until the row converges (typically via the
     * owner); either side's next outbound reconcile dial (outbound is never
     * gated) re-establishes the DATA link — self-healing for data, visible as a
     * transient deny. That self-healing story never covered a reservation, which
     * is exactly why the relay-enabled path above exists.

     * one failed heartbeat is already half the budget, and a single miss costs nothing.
     *
     * Say-once, re-armed by the next successful publish ({@link noteSelfRecordPublished}), so
     * a node that stays broken warns once rather than every 7.5 minutes.
     *
     * A node that has never published in this session is skipped: it has no record out there
     * to go stale, and the reason it has none (not a member yet, no signing key, revoked) is
     * already logged by `registerSelf` itself.
     *
     * Only a FAILED republish is checked. A heartbeat whose publish reports `skipped` neither
     * stamps nor warns, so a node that stops being able to publish without erroring — revoked,
     * or its row removed — goes quiet here. That is the intended reading: a revoked node has
     * nothing to publish and its unreachability is the point, not a fault to report.
     *
     * NOTE: the second `console.*` in this library, and the reason
     * {@link warnIfAnnounceAddrsDiscardRelay}'s note says a third should not simply be added:
     * both are operator warnings about a configuration/health condition an embedder cannot
     * see otherwise, and both have an event beside them (`control:write-abandoned` carries
     * the underlying write failure). A third such condition should surface through

     * entries are dropped (mirrors {@link drainPendingPeerWrites}). Best-effort — a

     * inherits that known gap, and a full disconnect→reconnect (or the next
     * process's sweep) re-covers it.

     * NOTE: the sweep is O(all tombstones ever) row-updates — plus one owner
     * signature each — in one transaction, once per lifetime. `Revocation` is
     * append-only and unbounded growth is declared acceptable for a cadre-sized
     * party. If the tombstone table ever gets large, bound the sweep (e.g. persist
     * a node-local high-water mark of what has been re-issued while connected)
     * instead of re-touching everything; note the `Math.max(...)` spread below also

     * discovering peer only does `addStrand` (the row already exists). Callers founding a
     * strand should use {@link foundStrand}, which performs both steps and is safe to
     * re-run — hand-rolling the pair is what left strands half-founded when an app was
     * killed between them.
     *
     * **Idempotent for identical content.** A live row whose `(Type, MemberPrivateKey)` match
     * the arguments is the state this call would have produced, so the call logs and returns
     * that row instead of writing — a publish interrupted after it committed can be repeated.
     * DIFFERENT content on the same id throws, naming the columns that differ, rather than
     * surfacing the raw `UNIQUE constraint failed: Strand.Id`: silently accepting it would
     * let a retry reopen a closed strand or swap the key gating its reads. The read and the
     * insert are not atomic, so a concurrent founder (two machines of one party, same id) is
     * caught on the insert's uniqueness rejection and resolved the same way — re-read, no-op
     * on a match, rethrow otherwise. Never an overwrite either way.
     *
     * A tombstoned strand is NOT resurrected here: {@link unpublishStrand} deletes the row, so
     * the idempotent branch is unreachable and the ordinary publish path re-seats it, exactly
     * as that method documents.
     *
     * **Already stuck on `UNIQUE constraint failed: Strand.Id`?** The row is already published
     * — attach, do NOT republish: `addStrand` (or {@link foundStrand}) with the id and, for a
     * closed strand, the `MemberPrivateKey` read back from the row. `unpublishStrand` + a
     * fresh publish also clears it for an OPEN strand, but is destructive for a closed one
     * (the key exists nowhere else). No app-data wipe is needed for either.
     *
     * The insert is signed with the ed25519 key behind this node's PeerId — which
     * {@link ed25519KeyPairFromLibp2p} also exposes as the node's owner keypair,
     * so peer identity and owner key are one and the same. That key is also persisted on the
     * row as `FounderOwnerKey` (the schema pins the column to the verified signer), which is
     * what later lets any launch derive "this machine is the founder" from the row alone.
     * The key must be enrolled in `OwnerKey` (e.g. via {@link ControlDatabase.ensureOwnerKey}
     * at genesis) or the schema's `Strand.AuthorizedInsert` constraint rejects the write.
     * Failing loudly here is intentional: a silently-unpublished strand would run
     * as a local-only island that no peer could ever discover or join.
     *
     * A CLOSED strand's publish also seats this party's own membership identity key —
     * the `StrandPartyKey` row {@link ensureStrandPartyKey} documents — which is what the
     * founder bootstrap derives `Member.Key`/`Manager.MemberKey` from. The
     * `memberPrivateKey` ARGUMENT stays the strand-wide read secret formation hands to

     *   the membership already seated in the strand.
     * - **instance already running** → the tracked instance is returned, and — because the

     *   `resolveCohortSeed` window — still ends up with its `Strand.Header` written.

     * Founder-ness is resolved FROM THE ROW, not assumed: this machine founds iff the
     * resolved row's `FounderOwnerKey` is its own owner key. A fresh publish records this

     * hazard. The returned {@link FoundStrandResult.founded} says which happened.

     * ({@link noteGuardedDelete}/{@link drainPendingRevocations}), so the stamp retirement
     * — and with it the consent re-seat foreclosure — does propagate; but the physical row
     * deletion cannot be replayed, and `queryStrands` reads raw (no retired-stamp filter),

     * BUDGET: the supervisor's first attempt is what `start()` waits on — deliberately the drive's
     * ordinary deadline rather than a boot-specific one. That deadline is now COUNTED, four link
     * round trips at the declared `network.linkRoundTripMs` plus the relay's two admission
     * decisions (18 s at its default, where it was a fixed 10 s): a healthy dial-plus-reserve is sub-second even over a WAN, so this is slack for
     * a slow link, while going much longer would make a dead relay indistinguishable from a hung
     * start and much shorter would fail nodes on links that were merely slow. A host that declares
     * a slower link lengthens it without touching this path — `link-budget.ts`. The retries carry
     * on in the background after this resolves, exactly as they do for a {@link reserveRelays}
     * caller.

     * `network.requireRelay === false` softens only the outcome below: a first

     * standing a strand runtime up. For the same reason every control-database check runs
     * before a wake: a strand that cannot issue anyway is not woken.
     *
     * `signal` is the formation's provisioning budget. Once it has aborted nothing is
     * issued — the joiner has already been told to retry, and an invitation written now
     * would only sit in the strand until it expires.
     *
     * The invitation expires `MEMBERSHIP_INVITE_TTL_MS` from now — see that constant for
     * the slow-joiner / lost-result tradeoff.
     *
     * NOTE: the issuing identity must be a `Strand.Manager` (the schema's `InviteValid`
     * gate), and only the FOUNDING party's key is seated as one. Today only the founder
     * party can host a bound formation at all — a joining party never gets the host
     * strand's control `Strand` row, so `resolveStrand` reports `missing` on it — so this
     * never bites. If a joined party is ever able to host formations into a strand it
     * joined (re-invite / multi-hop join), issuance here fails the manager gate and every
     * such redemption rejects with the retryable-sounding
     * `MEMBERSHIP_INVITE_UNAVAILABLE_REASON` forever; that flow needs manager delegation,
     * not a retry.

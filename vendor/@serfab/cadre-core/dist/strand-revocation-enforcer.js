/**
 * Strand revoked-peer enforcement: a per-strand deny gate that refuses the
 * network nodes of a REMOVED party, so removal means "we stop talking to you"
 * rather than only deleting a row.
 *
 * ## The deny set is revocation-keyed, never membership-keyed
 *
 * A strand node maintains a materialized in-memory set of revoked peer ids:
 * every `Strand.MemberPeer.PeerId` whose `MemberKey` has no live `Strand.Member`
 * row. `MemberPeer.MemberExists` runs on insert, so an orphaned binding can only
 * mean "this member existed and was removed" — it is exactly the durable,
 * replicated record of a removed party's machines. Everything NOT in the set is
 * admitted. Deliberate consequences:
 *
 * - **Open strands are untouched.** `Member`/`MemberPeer` carry `OnlyClosed`
 *   checks, so an open strand has no rows and the set is empty — and
 *   `StrandInstanceManager` additionally skips arming this enforcer entirely for
 *   `Type !== 'c'`, so an open strand does not even poll.
 * - **A joining party mid-admission is admitted** (it has no orphaned binding).
 *   An allowlist ("only peers bound to live members") was considered and
 *   rejected: a joiner's first membership writes must travel through the very
 *   cohort an allowlist would close to it — the same mutual-denial trap the
 *   control network's gater doc describes (`membership-connection-gater.ts`),
 *   with no enrollment window to carve out. A deny-list on positive evidence
 *   has no such trap.
 * - **Stale-view failure direction: fail-open.** A remaining member that has not
 *   yet replicated the revocation keeps serving the removed party until the
 *   tombstoned state arrives — bounded by replication, consistent with
 *   "revocation is forward-looking". The opposite error (denying a legitimate
 *   member) is only reachable for a revoked-then-re-admitted party at a node
 *   that saw the revoke but not the re-add; the re-add gives the member key a
 *   live `Member` row again, which removes its peers from the deny set as the
 *   row replicates — self-healing, and the re-adding manager's own node updates
 *   first, so the heal never depends on talking to the peer being wrongly denied.
 * - **Orphaned `MemberPeer` rows are load-bearing**: they ARE the deny record —
 *   the `Strand.Revocation` tombstone keeps only the stamp, not the peer id — so
 *   nothing here (or anywhere) tombstones or auto-cleans them at revocation.
 *   The manager-cleanup path (`removeMemberPeer`'s manager branch) stays as the
 *   only way to clear a wrongly-registered binding, and clearing an orphan
 *   forgets the denial (the NOTE at that branch says so).
 *
 * ## Removal cuts LIVE sessions too — the refresh IS the teardown seam
 *
 * Refusing NEW connections only half-honors "no longer be answered to or
 * communicated with": a long-lived strand connection may never re-dial, so
 * without teardown a removed party keeps whatever session it already holds.
 * There is no push notification to hang teardown off — a REPLICATED revocation
 * arrives with no change event (the strand database has no reactive
 * subscription; `StrandWatcher` polls for the same reason), and a LOCAL
 * `revokeMember`/`leaveStrand` writes through a bare `Database` handle this
 * runtime never sees — so teardown rides the snapshot refresh itself, with
 * `refresh()` exposed for immediacy
 * (`StrandInstanceManager.refreshRevocationEnforcement` →
 * `CadreNode.refreshRevocationEnforcement`).
 *
 * The sweep is driven by MEMBERSHIP in the deny set, never by an
 * entered-the-set diff: every refresh hangs up every currently-connected
 * revoked peer, so a resume, a crashed refresh, or a connection established
 * between two refreshes cannot leave a session standing (a diff would be a
 * strict subset of this, so none is kept). A peer with no open connection is
 * simply not swept, and a failed `hangUp` is logged, never thrown — the next
 * refresh retries it. `hangUp` closes DIRECT and RELAYED connections alike, and
 * on a strand node running the relay server it also drops any reservation the
 * revoked peer holds there (a reservation dies with its connection — see the
 * relay-seam doc in `membership-connection-gater.ts`).
 *
 * Teardown is also what stops OUTBOUND traffic. The gate is one-directional —
 * `authorizeStream` judges streams the revoked peer opens to US — so nothing
 * else prevents this node from pushing over an already-open connection, which
 * `PeerJoinBackfill` does for that connection's whole life. Closing the
 * connection stops both directions at once, which is why no separate outbound
 * gate exists.
 *
 * If this node's OWN peer id is in the set, it was itself removed (or it left —
 * a voluntary departure files the same tombstone). Nothing is torn down for
 * that: the other side's gate already refuses us, and every other revoked peer
 * is still swept. Instead `onSelfRevoked` fires ONCE per entry into the set
 * (re-armed if the party is re-admitted, so a second removal signals again),
 * which `CadreNode` surfaces as `strand:revoked` so the embedding app decides
 * what to do — this module never stops or leaves a strand on its own.
 * Best-effort by nature: a removed party learns only if the tombstone
 * replicated to it before the cut.
 *
 * ## What transfers from the control gater (`membership-connection-gater.ts`)
 *
 * Transfers: the two-layer shape (fail-closed per-stream gate as PRIMARY, an
 * opportunistic connection-level deny on top), the synchronous in-memory
 * snapshot judged by the stream gate (a live DB read inside a gate deadlocks —
 * the same argument as the control node's `authorizeInboundControlStream`), the
 * fail-open-on-error/timeout posture for the connection hooks
 * (`decideWithinDeadline`, reused as-is), and the "compose over the caller's
 * gater, every base hook preserved" mechanics.
 *
 * Does NOT transfer — the relay-reservation seam (`'admit-for-relay'` + the
 * unauthorized budget). That machinery exists because the control gate denies on
 * ABSENCE of placement, where a member whose row is in flight is
 * indistinguishable from an outsider and a wrong reservation deny is
 * unrecoverable. This gate denies on POSITIVE revocation evidence, so a
 * reservation deny is never that kind of wrong answer; the one stale-wrong case
 * (a missed re-add) heals via replication as above. `denyInboundRelayReservation`
 * here is therefore a plain "deny iff revoked" — no budget, no admit-for-relay
 * verdict, no reserve deadline.
 *
 * Does NOT transfer — the bring-up quiet period. A strand node's DB bring-up
 * NEEDS its cross-party cohort connections; this enforcer simply starts with an
 * empty snapshot (admit everything) until its first successful read — the same
 * fail-open posture as everywhere else here.
 *
 * Does NOT transfer — every stranger carve-out (enrollment window, formation
 * window, delegate grants). None of those protocols exist on a strand node.
 *
 * Unlike the control stream gate, no empty-snapshot carve-out is needed: an
 * empty deny set means "nothing revoked", which correctly admits everyone — the
 * deny-list shape makes the cold-start case and the steady case the same code
 * path.

 *
 *  - `denyInboundEncryptedConnection`: deny iff revoked, so a removed party's
 *    node is refused before any protocol negotiation.
 *  - `denyDialPeer`: deny iff revoked — the owner ruling covers "communicated
 *    with", not just "answered to", and refusing the dial locally is instant,
 *    which keeps Optimystic from wasting a dial timeout on a peer this node
 *    will not talk to anyway.
 *  - `denyInboundRelayReservation`: deny iff revoked — matters when the strand
 *    node runs the relay server (the storage-profile default), where admitting
 *    the reservation would let a removed party keep using this node's
 *    forwarding capacity.
 *
 * Composition semantics: every hook of `base` is preserved as-is; on the three
 * composed hooks a deny from EITHER the base gater or the revocation check
 * denies, and an error (or a decision slower than `decisionTimeoutMs`) in
 * either is fail-open — the base error admits through to the revocation check,
 * a revocation-check error admits outright, and the fail-closed stream gate
 * still stands behind both. The deadline is belt-and-braces: the snapshot read
 * is synchronous.
 *
 * NOTE: accepted tradeoff — swallowing a BASE hook's throw diverges from
 * `createMembershipConnectionGater`, which lets it propagate to libp2p (a
 * fail-closed outcome there). Uniform fail-open was chosen for this module so
 * every hook has one failure direction, and it was the shape the plan specified;
 * the cost is that an embedder gater which throws is silently admitted here
 * while the same gater passed raw to an OPEN strand would refuse. Loud in the
 * log either way. Revisit if an embedder ever ships a gater whose throw is a
 * meaningful deny, or if the two gaters are unified.
 *
 * NOTE: `base` is spread, so a gater passed as a CLASS INSTANCE would lose its
 * prototype methods — same caveat as `createMembershipConnectionGater`; every
 * caller in this repo supplies a plain object (the RN/web permissive gaters,
 * e.g. `{ denyDialMultiaddr: () => false }`, keep working unchanged).

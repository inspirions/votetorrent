/**
 * Translate `network.announceAddrs` / `network.appendAnnounceAddrs` — the operator-facing
 * "advertise these addresses" settings — into the two `@optimystic/db-p2p` `NodeOptions`
 * fields of the same names, which reach libp2p's `addresses.announce` /
 * `addresses.appendAnnounce`.
 *
 * Two jobs, both of which the control node and every strand node need identically, hence
 * one module rather than the same conditional spread written twice:
 *
 * - **Empty means unset.** libp2p treats `announce: []` as "no override", and forwarding
 *   `[]` would still be forwarding a field. An empty config array is dropped so it cannot
 *   land as an explicit empty announce set.
 * - **Validate the multiaddrs here, at start.** libp2p does NOT validate announce addrs
 *   at construction: `AddressManager` stores them as raw strings and only parses them on
 *   the first `getAnnounceAddrs()`. A typo therefore produces a node that starts
 *   cleanly, then throws `InvalidMultiaddrError` out of every `getMultiaddrs()` call —
 *   including an UNHANDLED one from the debounced peer-store update libp2p runs on
 *   `transport:listening`. Verified against libp2p's `address-manager` (its constructor
 *   does `announce.map(ma => ma.toString())`; `getAnnounceAddrs()` does `multiaddr(a)`).
 *   Parsing each entry up front converts that into a loud failure at node start, which is
 *   what {@link relayCircuitAddrs} already does for `network.relayAddrs`.
 *
 *   Parsing alone is not enough, though: `''` and `'/'` both parse into a component-less
 *   multiaddr, and a set holding only those is non-empty by the rule above — so it would
 *   replace every advertised address with nothing at all. An entry naming no address is
 *   therefore rejected alongside one that fails to parse.

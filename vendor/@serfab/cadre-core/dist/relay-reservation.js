/**
 * Relay reservation for nodes that reserve through the SEARCH listen addr — the
 * dial, the explicit reservation request, the retry loop that keeps it, and the
 * (live) status derivation.
 *
 * `@libp2p/circuit-relay-v2`'s listener branches on the SHAPE of the listen
 * address:
 *
 * | listen addr                                       | libp2p behaviour                                                                     | unreachable relay          |
 * | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
 * | `<dial addr>/p2p/<relayPeerId>/p2p-circuit`        | CONFIGURED reservation: dial that exact relay and reserve, or fail                     | `listen()` throws          |
 * | bare `/p2p-circuit`                                | SEARCH mode: register a pending reservation, to be filled by relay discovery           | nothing throws, no reserve |
 *
 * A search listener needs someone to (a) dial the relay and (b) fill the pending
 * reservation it created, then report whether one actually landed. That is this
 * module. It is **fail-soft by construction**: nothing here throws.
 *
 * EVERY cadre CONTROL node now takes that route — `network.relayAddrs` resolves
 * to the bare search entry (`relay-addrs.ts` → `resolveListenAddrs`) and
 * `CadreNode.start()` drives this module once the control database is up. The
 * configured shape would dial the relay from inside `libp2p.start()`, putting a
 * sibling in this node's cohort before its own control database existed, and a
 * sibling that has not yet replicated this node's `CadrePeer` row correctly
 * refuses its control-DB streams — which killed `start()` outright.
 *
 * So the two shapes are no longer alternative ROUTES, only alternative failure
 * postures on top of the same drive: a node that names `network.relayAddrs` gets
 * a `RelayReservationFailedError` out of `start()` when the first attempt lands
 * nothing (fail-fast, the operator asked for this relay), while a node that calls
 * `CadreNode.reserveRelays()` itself gets a non-`reserved` status and stays up
 * (fail-soft, the browser-tab posture). `network.requireRelay: false` gives a
 * CONFIGURED relay the fail-soft posture too, for a node that must boot with no
 * network at all — same drive, same supervisor, only the throw is dropped.
 * Configuring both is now redundant, not fatal.
 *
 * STRAND nodes take the same route, ONE supervisor PER RELAY
 * (`strand-instance-manager.ts` → `buildStrandRuntime`): each configured relay
 * gets its own bare `/p2p-circuit` listener (`strand-network-config.ts`) and its
 * own {@link superviseRelayReservation} over just that relay's addr, fail-soft
 * like the browser tab. The configured shape they used to take
 * (`<relay>/p2p-circuit`, reserved from inside `libp2p.start()`) is gone from
 * cadre-built nodes entirely, because it loses its address and never recovers in
 * three situations — the relay restarts, either side hangs up the relay
 * connection, and libp2p's OWN reservation refresh (which removes the reservation
 * before re-creating it, and a configured listener republishes only from inside
 * its own `listen()`). The last one needs no network event at all: at the relay
 * default TTL of two hours every configured-shape node went undialable ~1 h 55 min
 * after reserving. A search listener republishes on `relay:created-reservation`
 * for its own pending id, which the refresh re-queues, and the supervisor covers
 * the other two.
 *
 * Because a strand node runs one supervisor per relay, "is the reservation held"
 * is asked PER RELAY ({@link circuitMultiaddrsVia}): relay X's supervisor must not
 * be satisfied by relay Y's circuit addr, or it would never re-drive X.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE RESERVATION IS REQUESTED EXPLICITLY RATHER THAN LEFT TO DISCOVERY.
 * libp2p fills a search listener's pending reservation from `RelayDiscovery`,
 * which nominates a peer only once it can see the relay-hop protocol id in that
 * peer's PEER-STORE protocol list — and that list is written exclusively by the
 * IDENTIFY handshake. `@optimystic/db-p2p` gives every cadre node a
 * network-namespaced identify protocol id (`/optimystic/control-<partyId>/id/1.0.0`)
 * while the relay `ops/docker/libp2p-infra` deploys runs stock identify
 * (`/ipfs/id/1.0.0`), so the two never identify each other, the peer store stays
 * empty of protocols, and discovery never nominates the relay. The TCP/WebSocket
 * connection itself is fine, which is why leaving it to discovery surfaced as a
 * generic timeout.
 *
 * Identify is incidental to relaying, though: the reservation
 * (`/libp2p/circuit/relay/0.2.0/hop`), a third peer's CONNECT through the relay,
 * and the STOP handler on this node all use STOCK, un-namespaced protocol ids the
 * deployed relay already serves. Discovery's only job is to GUESS which connected
 * peer is a relay, and this module does not need to guess — it was handed the
 * relay's address. So it asks the relay for a slot directly, via the
 * circuit-relay transport's own reservation store.
 *
 * Status is derived from the node's LIVE multiaddrs on every read rather than
 * cached at drive time: when a relay restarts or the connection drops, libp2p's
 * listener clears its listening addrs and the circuit multiaddr disappears, so a
 * cached snapshot would keep claiming `reserved` for a node nothing can dial.
 *
 * And because discovery is out of reach, nothing would ever ASK again either —
 * so {@link driveRelayReservation} stays a single-shot primitive and
 * {@link superviseRelayReservation} owns the retry cadence on top of it. That
 * loop is what makes a lost reservation recover without a page reload. Single-shot
 * but not unstoppable: the primitive takes an `AbortSignal` and the loop trips it
 * from `stop()`, because a drive left running against a node being torn down both
 * logs failures that read as real and — through the timers it still holds — keeps
 * the process alive for the rest of its `timeoutMs`.
 *
 * One measured refinement to "out of reach": libp2p 3.1.3's `connection.newStream`
 * records every protocol OUR OWN outbound stream negotiated into the peer store, so
 * the explicit reservation request writes the relay-hop protocol id against the
 * relay itself. From then on, discovery CAN refill a freed slot on its own — but
 * only when the relay answers at that moment (a hangup while the relay stays up;
 * measured at ~25 ms). A relay that is down when the slot frees fails that one
 * discovery attempt, which poisons the store's `relayFilter` against it, and
 * nothing in libp2p tries again: a relay RESTART still needs the supervisor, which
 * un-poisons the filter before every attempt ({@link clearRelayFilterEntry}). Two
 * mechanisms in production, one guarantee; the specs disable discovery's half
 * (`forgetRelayProtocol` in `relay-reservation.spec.ts`) so they prove the
 * supervisor's.

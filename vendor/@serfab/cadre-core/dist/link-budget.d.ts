/**
 * Dial and reservation budgets derived from ONE declared link round trip, instead of fixed
 * millisecond numbers chosen on a fast local network.
 *
 * Reaching another machine through a relay costs a FIXED NUMBER OF EXCHANGES, not a fixed
 * number of milliseconds. So every budget written as milliseconds has a link speed above which
 * it can never open a connection at all — and the slower the link, the more of them fall over,
 * silently, because an abandoned dial looks the same as a peer that is not there. Counting round
 * trips instead is what stops that class of defect coming back: the next person to widen a
 * budget changes ONE declaration, and the next person to add a dial writes down its round-trip
 * count beside the arithmetic.
 *
 * This module is the only place a new deadline over the link should be written, and in
 * cadre-core's source `yarn lint` enforces it (`LINK_DEADLINE_GUARD` in `eslint.config.mjs`): a
 * value named `…TIMEOUT_MS`, `…BUDGET_MS` or `…DEADLINE_MS` (or `…TimeoutMs` and the like) set
 * to a number rather than a derivation fails, unless the line above it gives one of four
 * reasons. `// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-syntax -- link-independent: <why>` keeps a
 * deadline that never waits on the link; `-- link-bound, not yet derived: <ticket slug>` marks
 * one that does and names the ticket that owns converting it. Grep for the second to list the
 * deadlines this module does not yet cover. `-- cuts off by design: <why>; see
 * docs/cadre-consistency.md → "Deadlines Over Optimystic's Reads and Commits"` keeps a deadline
 * that does wait on the link, through an Optimystic read or commit, but whose value is what its
 * caller can tolerate: it gives up on purpose and must not grow with the link. That doc section
 * lists every such site. `-- measured, not derived: <where the measurement lives>` keeps a
 * deadline that waits on the link but has no round-trip count to derive from, because it bounds
 * a whole phase of many exchanges whose number depends on the data (a joining machine's first
 * sync): its value is sized from a recorded measurement, which the directive names, and it is
 * re-measured rather than recomputed when a number under it moves.
 *
 * Optimystic's per-peer cohort read deadline is derived here too ({@link cohortReadDeadlineMs}),
 * but declared in another package: `COHORT_READ_DEADLINE_MS` in
 * `quereus-plugin-sereus/src/cluster-size.ts` is the same arithmetic at the default declaration,
 * spelled as a number because that package cannot import this one. `link-budget.spec.ts` pins
 * the two equal.
 *
 * ── The instrument ──
 *
 * Every count and every number below, except the commit count, comes from
 * `packages/integration-tests/src/scenarios/relayed-dial-cost-by-latency.integration.ts`, which
 * is committed and opt-in (`RELAY_DIAL_COST=1`). **Its doc comment is the single home of the
 * measurement**; this module holds only what the derivation needs. Re-run it before changing
 * anything here. The commit count ({@link COMMIT_ROUND_TRIPS}) is a whole-operation
 * measurement from `relay-round-trip-measure.integration.ts` instead, and its figures live on
 * the constant.
 *
 * ── The unit ──
 *
 * ONE LINK ROUND TRIP is a message from one machine reaching the other and a reply coming
 * back, over the path those two machines actually use — through the relay, when that is the
 * only way they can reach each other. In the instrument, which injects a constant ONE-WAY
 * frame delay `d`, one link round trip is `2d`.
 *
 * A leg between a node and the RELAY is half a link round trip, because it crosses one of the
 * two hops rather than both. That is why the reservation drive's cost reads as "four
 * node-to-relay round trips" in one telling and "two link round trips" in another: same
 * quantity, different unit. This module uses the LINK round trip throughout, so there is one
 * unit to reason in.
 *
 * ── The counts, and what they cost ──
 *
 * | operation                                            | link round trips | at the declared default |

 * | one request and its answer over an open circuit       | 2                | 7 000 ms                |

 * | one Optimystic commit over connections already open   | 20               | 70 000 ms               |
 *
 * The reservation-request row is {@link RELAY_RESERVE_REQUEST_ROUND_TRIPS}, which also sizes how long
 * a party-run relay waits for a stranger's reservation ({@link relayAdmissionReserveDeadlineMs}).
 * The commit row is a measurement of a whole write, not a count of exchanges; its doc comment
 * ({@link COMMIT_ROUND_TRIPS}) holds the figures and says when to re-measure it.
 *
 * **Measured** 2026-09-26, one Windows machine, loopback dedicated relay: a relayed dial took
 * 20-25 ms at no delay, **7 255-7 279 ms at 900 ms one-way**, and **12 066-12 094 ms at 1 500 ms
 * one-way**. Four link round trips of pure delay would be 7 200 and 12 000, so the real cost
 * sits about 60-95 ms ABOVE the arithmetic — the handshakes, which no delay figure contains.
 * That residue is why {@link DECLARED_LINK_ROUND_TRIP_MS} carries headroom over the link sereus
 * supports rather than matching it exactly: a declaration equal to the supported round trip
 * would derive a budget marginally BELOW the dial it has to contain.
 *
 * ── The listener's admission decision ──
 *
 * The table is link time only. Every budget that OPENS a connection also adds
 * {@link ADMISSION_DECISION_TIMEOUT_MS} (2 000 ms) per admission decision the machine being
 * called may make on the way, because that machine's gate runs on the dialer's clock (the
 * constant's doc says why). So a relayed dial is budgeted at 14 000 + 2 000 = 16 000 ms at the
 * default declaration, a dial plus one request at 23 000 ms, and a reservation drive, which a
 * party-run relay decides twice, at 18 000 ms. The allowance is flat: it is local decision
 * time, not link time, so it does not scale with the declaration.
 *
 * The measurement above crossed no gate. The instrument is bare libp2p on both sides, with no
 * cadre connection gater, so the 12 094 ms contains no admission decision at all. The
 * allowance is therefore on top of the measured dial rather than already inside it.
 *
 * NOTE: the measured dial also reused a connection to the relay that the dialer already held
 * (the instrument dials the relay first). A relayed dial that has to open that connection itself
 * spends one more link round trip, plus the relay's own admission decision when the relay is a
 * party-run control node, and the count counts neither; at the supported link such a dial fits
 * only while the called machine decides in under about 0.9 s.
 * `bug-relayed-dial-budget-omits-opening-the-relay-connection`.
 *
 * ── libp2p's own two limits ──
 *
 * Two limits inside libp2p bound the same relayed dial as cadre's budgets do, and both were
 * 10 000 ms until `@optimystic/db-p2p` 1.7.0 let an embedder set them: the DIALER's
 * `connectionManager.dialTimeout`, which bounds every dial that carries no abort signal of its
 * own, and the LISTENER's `connectionManager.inboundUpgradeTimeout`, which is how long the
 * machine being called lets a half-built connection finish its handshakes. At 10 000 ms each,
 * no relayed connection could be opened above about 1 250 ms one-way (a 2.5-second link round
 * trip) whatever cadre declared. The listener's limit is the one that makes that failure
 * silent: at 1 500 ms one-way the dialer's own 12 094 ms dial RESOLVED while the listener had
 * already thrown the connection away at 10 s, so the first stream over it died with
 * `Unexpected EOF - stream closed while reading 0/1 bytes` and the listener reported no peer at
 * all. cadre now declares both from this module ({@link connectionManagerTimeouts}) on the
 * control node and every strand node.
 *
 * ── What still fails at the supported link ──
 *
 * - **Optimystic's own request dials.** `@optimystic/db-p2p`'s RPC clients dial with fixed
 *   3 000 ms deadlines of their own (`DEFAULT_DIAL_TIMEOUT_MS`, the `pushDialTimeoutMs`
 *   defaults), which neither limit above reaches because a caller's signal replaces
 *   `dialTimeout`. So an Optimystic request that has to OPEN a relayed connection fails above
 *   375 ms one-way. A request over a connection that is already open does not dial, but its
 *   protocol negotiation runs under the same signal (`openProtocolStream` forwards it into
 *   `newStream`), and one negotiation is one link round trip: at the supported link every
 *   cohort consult is therefore aborted at 3.0 s, before {@link cohortReadDeadlineMs} is
 *   reached (measured 2026-09-29; the figures are on `COHORT_READ_DEADLINE_MS`). The
 *   connections cadre opens itself are budgeted here. Upstream:
 *   `debt-rpc-dial-deadlines-cannot-open-a-slow-relayed-connection` in optimystic, and
 *   `tickets/blocked/report-request-dial-deadline-cuts-cohort-consults-on-open-connections-to-optimystic`
 *   here, carrying the open-connection finding to it.
 * - **A machine that declares a faster link than its peers.** Every machine is the listener
 *   for the others, so its `inboundUpgradeTimeout` — derived from ITS declaration — bounds
 *   connections other machines open to it. A peer declaring 3 500 ms dialing a machine that
 *   declared 500 ms gets exactly the silent failure above. Strand formation has the same
 *   shape: the joiner derives how long it waits for the host's reply from ITS declaration and
 *   the host derives its provisioning budget from its own, so a joiner declaring a faster
 *   link than the host gives up on a reply the host is still entitled to send. Declare the
 *   same link on every machine of a party.
 *   Relay admission too: a party-run relay derives how long a stranger has to ask for a
 *   reservation from ITS declaration ({@link relayAdmissionReserveDeadlineMs}), so a relay
 *   declaring a faster link than a client closes that client's connection before its request
 *   arrives.

/**
 * The link round trip cadre assumes when a host declares none, in milliseconds. A deployment
 * that knows its own link states it with `NetworkConfig.linkRoundTripMs` instead.
 *
 * **Why 3 500.** Sereus supports two machines that reach each other only through a relay up to
 * a **3-second link round trip** (1 500 ms each way — a congested mobile or satellite link;
 * `docs/architecture.md` → "Relay Integration"). The worst relayed dial measured at that link
 * was 12 094 ms, above the 12 000 ms a declaration of exactly 3 000 would derive, so the
 * declaration rounds the supported link up to the next half second. 3 500 derives 14 000 ms
 * of link time and leaves about 1.9 s over that dial: room for a phone's Noise handshake,
 * which the loopback measurement on a desktop does not contain. The listener's admission
 * decision is not in that 1.9 s; it has its own allowance on top (the module doc's "The
 * listener's admission decision"). (The previous 2 000 followed the same convention for the
 * 1.8 s band sereus supported before, with about 720 ms to spare.)
 *
 * One budget outside this module does NOT move with it: `DEFAULT_STRAND_FIRST_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS`
 * (`strand-first-sync-gate.ts`) bounds a whole first sync, which has no round-trip count, so it
 * is sized from a measurement instead and re-measured when this declaration or the cohort read
 * deadline moves. The per-peer cohort read deadline itself does move with it
 * ({@link cohortReadDeadlineMs}).
 *
 * What 3 500 costs, against 2 000: a peer that is genuinely gone holds each operation longer
 * before it is abandoned and retried — the link part of a relayed dial or a reservation drive
 * 14 s instead of 8 s, and of a control-cohort dial of one peer across all its addresses 56 s
 * instead of 32 s. The admission allowance adds to both (see {@link relayedDialBudgetMs}).
 * Raise it further for a link slower still; lower it only on a deployment where EVERY machine
 * of the party is that close, for the reason the "What still fails" list gives.

 * It lives here, not beside the gaters, because the dial budgets below add it
 * and this module imports nothing of cadre-core's own: importing the gater
 * would close the cycle link-budget → membership-connection-gater →
 * seed-bootstrap → link-budget.
 *
 * libp2p awaits `denyInboundEncryptedConnection` inside the inbound upgrade
 * WITHOUT racing its inbound-upgrade timeout signal (unlike the pre-encryption
 * `denyInboundConnection` hook), so a decision that never settles wedges that
 * upgrade forever — the connection-manager's inbound-upgrade slot is taken by
 * `acceptIncomingConnection` and released in the `finally` that never runs. The
 * real policy reads the control DB (`listAuthorizedMembers`), which can pull
 * over the network, so "never settles" is reachable. Bounding it keeps the
 * fail-open contract honest: a slow decision admits rather than silently
 * failing closed (or not at all).
 *
 * The control gate's decision waits on the link, through two live control reads
 * (`Revocation`, then `CadrePeer`) that can consult the cohort, yet this deadline
 * cuts it off on purpose and must not grow with the link:
 *
 * - **Fail-open is the designed outcome.** An expired decision admits a
 *   connection and nothing more: the per-protocol stream gates still refuse
 *   every members-only protocol from the materialized snapshot, and unplaced
 *   relay reservations stay capped (`MAX_UNAUTHORIZED_RELAY_RESERVATIONS`).
 * - **The slow case is bring-up, not steady state.** A membership read consults
 *   the cohort only for a block this node does not hold, or before the
 *   `Revocation` ledger marker exists; once the marker exists every block the
 *   decision reads is held (`control-founding-consult-budget.spec.ts` pins both
 *   states). So the gate always fails open only on a node whose membership reads
 *   still consult: one consult costs about two link round trips, and asking a
 *   silent peer costs the per-peer read deadline ({@link cohortReadDeadlineMs}, 7 s
 *   at the default declaration).
 * - **The decision is spent on the dialing machine's clock.** libp2p's listener
 *   runs this gate before it answers the multiplexer negotiation the dialer is
 *   waiting on (`libp2p/dist/src/upgrader.js`), and the listener's own
 *   `inboundUpgradeTimeout` is already running while it does. So
 *   {@link relayedDialBudgetMs}, and every budget built on it, adds this
 *   deadline once per decision the called machine may make, and the two libp2p
 *   limits ({@link connectionManagerTimeouts}) contain it by construction.
 *   Raising it therefore lengthens every dial budget with it: a slow decision
 *   still fits, and a dial to a peer that is gone takes that much longer to
 *   give up.
 *
 * `CONTROL_READ_RETRY_BUDGET_MS` must stay below this, which

 *
 * {@link CIRCUIT_REQUEST_ROUND_TRIPS} at the declared link round trip: 2 x 3 500 = 7 000 ms at
 * the default declaration. A read-path request opens a fresh protocol stream over a connection
 * that is already open (`@optimystic/db-p2p`'s `openProtocolStream`), so it costs the protocol
 * negotiation plus the request and its answer, and no dial. No admission allowance either: the
 * called machine decided that when the connection was opened. This deadline governs only what
 * Optimystic's own fixed 3 000 ms dial deadline lets through: a request that must first dial,
 * and at the supported link the stream negotiation itself, is cut off by that one first (the
 * module doc's "What still fails").
 *
 * Optimystic derives its whole-reconcile-pass bound from this value, `max(5 000, 5 x per-peer)`
 * (`db-p2p/src/cluster/cluster-policy.ts`): 35 000 ms at the default declaration.
 *
 * What it costs, against the 5 000 ms that preceded it: a peer that is truly gone holds a read
 * of a block missing locally 7 s instead of 5 s before the read is declined and retried, and a
 * joining machine's first sync runs several such consults. That is why
 * `DEFAULT_STRAND_FIRST_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS` is re-measured whenever this moves; the bands are on
 * that constant.
 *
 * The plugin declares the same number as `COHORT_READ_DEADLINE_MS` (it cannot import this
 * module), and `link-budget.spec.ts` pins the two equal.

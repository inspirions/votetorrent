/**
 * Control-network inbound admission gates (defense-in-depth): the
 * encrypted-connection checkpoint and the circuit-relay reservation checkpoint.
 *
 * Layer 2 of the membership enforcement chain: the PRIMARY gates are per-stream
 * — every sensitive sereus control protocol rejects a peer that fails the
 * voucher-anchored membership check (wake and strand-addr via
 * `CadreNode.isAuthorizedMember`; the Optimystic control-DB protocols via the
 * materialized-snapshot gate `CadreNode.authorizeInboundControlStream`), and
 * the replicated rows an outsider *can* still write are disbelieved at read
 * time. This module adds the opportunistic connection-level layer on top: a
 * peer this node can positively determine is NOT authorized is refused at the
 * encrypted-connection checkpoint, before any protocol negotiation, so a
 * known-nothing outsider is never even in the conversation — EXCEPT on a node
 * that runs the circuit-relay server, where the refusal moves to the
 * relay-reservation checkpoint instead (see "The relay-reservation seam").
 *
 * ## The stranger allowlist (the ONE place it is defined)
 *
 * A libp2p connection gater decides per CONNECTION, before protocols are
 * negotiated, so "allow seed, deny repo" cannot be expressed here — instead the
 * policy admits a connection whenever a legitimate stranger interaction could be
 * riding it, and the per-stream gates take over. The complete set of protocols a
 * NOT-yet-authorized peer may legitimately speak on a control node is:
 *
 *  - `/sereus/seed/1.0.0` ({@link SEED_PROTOCOL}) — enrollment seed delivery.
 *    An owner dials a brand-new node to seed it (the new node has no members
 *    yet, so its gate is inert), and an invited phone dials the owner before it
 *    is authorized (admitted via the enrollment window `CadreNode.createInvite`
 *    opens). The handler's own trust decision is the anchored seed-trust policy.
 *  - `/sereus/formation/1.0.0` ({@link FORMATION_PROTOCOL}) — cross-party
 *    strand formation via open invitations. Stranger-facing BY DESIGN: the
 *    initiator is another party, and its token is only checkable inside the
 *    protocol. The exemption is therefore keyed on EXPECTATION of a stranger,
 *    not capability to serve one: stranger denial is suspended only while this
 *    node has at least one UNEXPIRED, NOT-FULLY-CONSUMED open invitation
 *    outstanding (`StrandSolicitationService.hasOutstandingInvitation` — the
 *    tokens this process minted or published, plus any still-redeemable
 *    `FormationInvite` row the usage recorder can see). Merely registering the
 *    responder (`CadreNode.initializeStrandSolicitation`) does NOT suspend it,
 *    so an app that registers eagerly at node bring-up keeps a live gate. The
 *    handler's own trust decision remains the per-token check, which is
 *    strictly finer than this one: a peer admitted here can still be rejected
 *    in-protocol for a bogus or spent token.
 *
 * There is one further connection-level carve-out, which is NOT a protocol
 * exemption and needs no stranger window:
 *
 *  - **Announced delegate peers** (`delegate-admission.ts`). A member's strand
 *    node runs as a separate libp2p identity whose peerId no sibling can
 *    recompute. Before starting a strand node, a member's control node
 *    announces that peerId over the already-authenticated strand-addr RPC, and
 *    the receiver holds a short-lived grant for it
 *    (`CadreNode.grantDelegateAdmission`). The grant admits the CONNECTION,
 *    admits the peer's RESERVATION at the seam below (without spending the
 *    unauthorized budget), and nothing else — it is deliberately invisible to
 *    the per-stream gate, so a delegate still gets refused on every
 *    members-only protocol.
 *
 * VoteTorrent patch (public-observer-protocol): there is one further
 * connection-level carve-out beyond the two above, also NOT a protocol
 * exemption in the ordinary sense — it is keyed on this node's OWN
 * configuration, not on anything the remote peer presents. A node started
 * with a non-empty, node-local observable-strand allowlist admits every
 * inbound connection unconditionally at this checkpoint, exactly as if it
 * had no allowlist-gated protocol to protect here at all. The carve-out is
 * necessarily peer-blind: this hook runs before protocol negotiation, so
 * "admit the public-observer request, deny everything else" cannot be
 * expressed at the connection layer — only at the per-stream layer, which is
 * untouched by this patch and still refuses such a peer every members-only
 * protocol (the four Optimystic control-DB protocols, wake, and
 * strand-addr). The carve-out is active ONLY on a node actually configured
 * with a non-empty allowlist; on every other node this checkpoint behaves
 * exactly as it did before the patch.
 *
 * ## The relay-reservation seam
 *
 * A circuit-relay reservation is established by the reserving peer DIALING the
 * relay, so at the relay it is an inbound connection — and killing that
 * connection kills the reservation. For a genuine member whose `CadrePeer` row
 * has not yet replicated to this node, a connection-level deny here is NOT
 * self-healing the way a data connection's is: an outbound reconcile dial
 * re-establishes a data link, but no outbound dial can grant the REMOTE peer a
 * reservation, and a relay-only peer has no address of its own to dial back —
 * the reservation IS its address. Boot ordering makes the window ordinary (a
 * node's circuit listener runs inside `libp2p.start()`, before its own row
 * could have replicated anywhere), and a stalled replication makes it
 * unbounded. So the relay would be answering a RELAY question ("may this peer
 * use my forwarding capacity?") with a MEMBERSHIP answer, at a checkpoint where
 * a wrong answer is unrecoverable.
 *
 * On a node whose relay server is enabled the two questions are separated:
 *
 *  - The policy returns `'admit-for-relay'` instead of `'deny'`, and the
 *    connection is ADMITTED. The fail-closed per-stream gates still refuse such
 *    a peer every members-only protocol, so it gains identify/ping and the
 *    relay hop protocol, nothing else.
 *  - The reservation itself is decided at libp2p's
 *    `denyInboundRelayReservation` hook (the circuit-relay server consults it
 *    per RESERVE request): the policy admits members, delegates and configured
 *    infra outright, and admits peers it cannot place only within a bounded
 *    budget ({@link UnauthorizedReservationBudget}) — a member whose row is in
 *    flight always finds a slot under any sane cap, while outsiders cannot
 *    annex the party's relay capacity. COUNT and lifetime are the only bounds
 *    on such a peer: a party-run relay forwards without libp2p's per-connection
 *    data and duration limit by default (`relay-server.ts`), so what a granted
 *    slot carries is not capped.
 *  - An `'admit-for-relay'` connection that is NOT reserving is dropped: it has
 *    {@link RELAY_ADMISSION_RESERVE_DEADLINE_MS} to get a reservation ADMITTED
 *    at that hook, after which the gate CLOSES the underlying connection so
 *    both ends let go of the socket. The guarantee above thus weakens on
 *    relay-enabled nodes from "never in the conversation" to "in it briefly,
 *    and can speak nothing".
 *
 * The deadline clears on reservation ADMISSION, not on the reservation's own
 * success: this gate cannot observe the server-side `reserve()` outcome, so a
 * peer whose admitted reservation is then refused for server capacity keeps its
 * connection until either side closes it — bounded and mute, so harmless.
 *
 * Everything else a control node handles — the Optimystic control-DB protocols
 * (`/optimystic/control-<party>/{repo,cluster,sync,block-transfer}/…`), wake
 * (`/sereus/strand-wake/1.0.0`), and strand-addr (`/sereus/strand-addr/1.0.0`)
 * — is members-only, and every one of them enforces that per-stream. Wake and
 * strand-addr check `isAuthorizedMember` inside their handlers; the four
 * control-DB protocols are gated by the fail-closed
 * `CadreNode.authorizeInboundControlStream` (wired as libp2p's
 * `authorizeInboundStream` upstream hook), which judges each inbound stream
 * against the MATERIALIZED authorized-peer snapshot — synchronous and
 * in-memory, because a live DB read from inside the gate would deadlock into
 * mutual denial. The two layers complement, not duplicate: this connection
 * gate is fail-open over a live DB read (deny only on positive proof of an
 * outsider), the stream gate is fail-closed over the snapshot and has NO
 * stranger carve-outs — an enrollment window admits a stranger's connection
 * for seed delivery, yet its repo streams are still refused.
 *
 * ## The bring-up quiet period
 *
 * One state is decided BEFORE any of the above, and is not about the remote peer
 * at all: while this node's control-database bring-up is in flight
 * (`InboundAdmissionPolicy.bringUpInFlight`), the gate denies BOTH directions —
 * `denyDialPeer` and `denyInboundEncryptedConnection` — and then opens.
 *
 * The invariant it protects is "`ControlDatabase.initialize()` runs while this
 * node holds ZERO control connections". Building that database is a long chain
 * of cohort-consulting block probes, and every connected same-party sibling is in
 * the cohort those probes consult. A sibling that has not yet replicated this
 * node's `CadrePeer` row correctly refuses them at its own fail-closed per-stream
 * gate, so ONE connection in this window turns bring-up into
 * `BlockUnavailableError` and `start()` rejects. Retrying cannot converge: the
 * condition that would clear the refusal is this node's own row reaching the
 * sibling, and writing that row needs the database the retry is building. So the
 * only fix is to not be in the conversation yet — which is what this window is.
 *
 * The ordering is arranged so nothing SHOULD open a connection here anyway:
 * `network.relayAddrs` resolves to a listener that dials nothing and reserves
 * after bring-up (`relay-addrs.ts`), and the control-cohort reconcile pass is
 * scheduled post-start. This window is what makes that a property rather than an
 * accident of ordering — the live case it actually catches is
 * `controlNetwork.bootstrapNodes`, where `@libp2p/bootstrap` emits its discovery
 * events ~1 s after `libp2p.start()` and the connection manager auto-dials from
 * there, which is a race bring-up wins only while raw-storage latency stays low.
 *
 * A denial here costs a retry, not a partition: libp2p's connection manager
 * re-dials on its auto-dial cadence, the reservation supervisor re-drives, and a
 * denied inbound peer reconnects. The window opens on bring-up FAILURE too (via
 * `CadreNode.cleanup`), so teardown is never gated.
 *
 * ## Fail-open, deliberately
 *
 * Outside that window this layer only ever denies on a POSITIVE determination of
 * "unauthorized outsider while no stranger path is open". Any error, missing
 * dependency, or ambiguous state admits the connection (and the reservation) and
 * defers to the fail-closed stream gates — a DB hiccup must not partition a
 * legitimate cadre.

 * whose relay server is off; libp2p never calls it there).
 *
 * `denyDialPeer` is composed too, but ONLY for the bring-up quiet period (see
 * the module doc): outside that window outbound dials are never gated by
 * membership — this node decides for itself who to talk to.
 *
 * Composition semantics: every hook of `base` is preserved as-is; on the three
 * composed hooks a deny from EITHER the base gater or the admission policy
 * denies. A policy error — or a decision slower than `decisionTimeoutMs` —
 * takes the fail-open outcome (connection admitted / reservation admitted, see
 * module doc); the base gater's verdict is still honored first.
 *
 * An `'admit-for-relay'` verdict admits the connection and arms a
 * `reserveDeadlineMs` timer against it; the timer is disarmed when a
 * reservation for that peer is ADMITTED at the reservation hook, and closes the
 * underlying `MultiaddrConnection` when it fires first.
 *
 * NOTE: `base` is spread, so a gater passed as a CLASS INSTANCE would lose its
 * prototype methods; every caller in this repo (and libp2p's own default)
 * supplies a plain object. If a class-based gater ever shows up, delegate
 * per-hook instead of spreading.
 *
 * Deny timing, as observed by the denied dialer: noise negotiates the muxer in
 * the security handshake's early data, so the DIALER's upgrade may complete
 * (its `dial()` resolves) before this receiver-side hook runs. The deny then
 * aborts the receiver's upgrade — the receiver never registers the connection
 * and never creates its muxer, so no protocol can ever be negotiated — and the
 * dialer sees its "open" connection close moments later.
 *
 * Control node only: strand cohort nodes legitimately connect cross-party
 * peers, so cadre membership never gates them. An OPEN strand's node receives
 * the raw configured gater unchanged; a CLOSED strand's node composes its own
 * revoked-peer denial onto it instead — a deny-list on positive revocation
 * evidence, not this module's membership admission — see
 * `strand-revocation-enforcer.ts`.

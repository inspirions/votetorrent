/**
 * Peer-address record helpers: the single source of truth for the bytes a node

 * another peer's row.
 *
 * The signed payload is a single SHA-256 digest over the shared domain-tagged
 * field vector (see control-authorization.ts) — the crypto plugin's injective
 * multi-field encoding, so no field split is ambiguous. It is intentionally NOT
 * JSON-canonicalized (deterministic across node/browser/RN, no key ordering)
 * and — crucially — is reconstructable inside the `CadrePeer.AuthorizedUpdate`
 * SQL constraint from the row's own columns:
 *
 *   digest('CadreControl.CadrePeer', 'publish',
 *          new.PeerId, new.Multiaddr, cast(new.UpdatedAt as text))
 *
 * Keep {@link peerRecordSignedPayload} and that constraint byte-for-byte in
 * sync. The `'publish'` action tag marks this as a peer's SELF-signed record
 * (signed with the peer's own key, not an owner key) and keeps it disjoint from
 * every owner-signed digest.
 *
 * `publicKey` is deliberately excluded from the payload — it is the key the
 * signature is verified *with* (so a signature already commits to exactly one
 * key), and its binding to `peerId` is checked separately at resolve time.

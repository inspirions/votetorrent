/**
 * connection-path.ts — classify each open libp2p connection as relayed
 * (`/p2p-circuit`) vs direct, tag its transport, and summarise counts plus a
 * "stuck on relay" condition.
 *
 * This is the **canonical** implementation. The web reference app keeps a
 * deliberate, documented duplicate at
 * `packages/reference-app-web/src/lib/connection-path.ts` (it does not depend on
 * `@serfab/cadre-core`). Keep the function signatures and classification table
 * identical across both copies so a future shared micro-package would be a
 * drop-in.
 *
 * The whole signal is a pure function over `node.getConnections()` + a settle
 * window + `Date.now()`. A connection's path is derivable from its `remoteAddr`
 * multiaddr string alone — no I/O, no events, no stateful observer.

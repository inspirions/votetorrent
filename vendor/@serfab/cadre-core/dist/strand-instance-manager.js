     *
     * @returns how the request resolved:
     * - `'already-founder'` — the retained config already founds; nothing to do.
     * - `'bootstrapped'` — config flipped and the live database ran the bootstrap.
     * - `'needs-resume'` — config flipped, but the instance is quiesced (no live
     *   database), so the bootstrap could not run here: the CALLER must wake the
     *   strand (`CadreNode.wakeStrand`, which owns the hibernation bookkeeping this
     *   manager does not) so the rebuild — which now founds — runs it.
     * @param resolvePartyKey - Asked for the party's own membership key when (and only
     *   when) a CLOSED strand's retained config carries none — the instance was launched
     *   as a joiner before its `StrandPartyKey` row existed or replicated. The resolved
     *   key is retained alongside the founder flip so the bootstrap (now, or on the
     *   caller's wake for `'needs-resume'`) can seat the founding Member/Manager.
     * @throws when the strand is not tracked — this seam exists only for the
     *   tracked-instance launch path; an untracked id is a caller bug.

 * The single definition of the field vector every signed control-plane message
 * covers. Both producers of signed bytes — `control-database.ts`'s
 * `buildAuthorizationMessage` (raw digest bytes) and `peer-authorization.ts`'s
 * digest helpers (base64url digest strings) — build their vector here, so the
 * byte layout cannot drift between them or away from the SQL constraints in
 * `schemas/control.qsql`.
 *
 * Every vector leads with two fixed literals:
 *
 *   digest(<domain>, <action>, <row field 1>, ..., <row field n>)
 *
 * so a signature verifies ONLY against the one rule it was minted for. Without
 * the tags, several rules built byte-identical tuples (e.g. `ValidationKey`
 * insert and `OwnerKey` insert both signed `digest(Key, StampId)`), so an
 * approval for a narrow grant doubled as an approval for full ownership.
 *
 * This module deliberately has no Quereus / Optimystic / libp2p imports so the
 * lightweight verifiers (`peer-authorization.ts`, consumed by the offline
 * `cadre enroll register` check) can use it without pulling in the runtime.

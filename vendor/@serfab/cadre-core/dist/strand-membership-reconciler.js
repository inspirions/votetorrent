/**
 * Strand membership reconciliation: the per-instance background loop that finishes a
 * party's join at strand bring-up. Every machine of a party that runs a closed strand
 * ends up with (1) the party's `Strand.Member` row seated — redeeming the
 * formation-staged invitation if one is pending — and (2) its own durable
 * machine→party binding (`Strand.MemberPeer`) written, which is what revocation
 * enforcement and future admission control key on.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * - **Never blocks or fails bring-up.** Armed by `StrandInstanceManager.buildStrandRuntime`
 *   right after the strand database initializes (launch AND hibernation resume — the one
 *   seam where a transport peer id and a live `Database` both exist), and every pass is
 *   fully contained: a joiner at that instant has typically not synced the founder's rows
 *   and may lack write quorum, so failure means "retry next tick", never a throw.
 * - **Kicked the moment its database appears.** A joining machine's first pass runs while
 *   the first-sync write gate still withholds `instance.database`, so it finds no database
 *   and returns at once. `StrandInstanceManager.publishDatabase` calls `reconcile()` as it
 *   hands the database to the app, which is what makes the join finish about a second after
 *   the strand becomes writable rather than on the next timer.
 * - **Retries fast while the join is unfinished, slowly while it is only waiting.** A pass
 *   that leaves the join unfinished re-arms on a ladder starting at
 *   {@link INITIAL_JOIN_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS} and doubling, capped at the configured poll
 *   interval (default {@link DEFAULT_REVOCATION_POLL_INTERVAL_MS}; an embedder's
 *   `revocationEnforcement.pollIntervalMs` is mirrored here by the instance manager). A pass
 *   that finds no member row AND no staged invitation is not an unfinished join but a wait
 *   for someone to admit this party — nothing this machine can do faster — so it re-arms on
 *   the flat poll interval and resets the ladder. The loop stops on the done state.
 * - **Done state**: the party's member row is visible locally, this machine's own binding
 *   is in place, AND no invitation is still staged — the loop stops. A LATER revocation is
 *   the enforcer's business, not this loop's; a resume rebuilds the reconciler and
 *   re-verifies from scratch (every write is idempotent, so re-running is free), and a
 *   fresh invitation staged on a done loop re-arms it in place ({@link rearm}).
 *
 * ## One pass
 *
 * 1. **Self-revocation check.** If the enforcer flags this node's own party as revoked and
 *    no invitation is staged, stop rather than fight — re-admission arrives (if ever) via
 *    a fresh formation, which re-arms the loop. With an invitation staged the loop reports
 *    the dead end (below) and carries on: the redemption is attempted like any other, and a
 *    manager's re-admission lets a later pass finish it.
 * 2. **Ensure membership.** Member row visible → done with this step; if a staged
 *    invitation is still unspent, BURN it ({@link burnInvite} — the `ConsumedInvite` row
 *    alone) so the bearer credential cannot be spent by anyone else. A burn refused by the
 *    cohort keeps the invitation staged for the next pass (it is the same write gate a
 *    redemption faces, and the local member row may be stale — see "Re-arming"); a dead
 *    invitation is dropped. Member row absent + staged invitation → {@link consumeInvite}
 *    under the party's own key, retried across passes until the `Invite` row has
 *    replicated here and the write commits. Absent with no invitation (founder rows not
 *    yet synced, or a machine whose party never joined) → keep waiting, escalating to one
 *    visible warning after {@link IDLE_PASSES_BEFORE_ESCALATION} passes, never throwing.
 * 3. **Ensure the binding.** {@link registerMemberPeer} (insert-if-absent, restart-safe)
 *    with this node's own strand transport peer id — only after step 2 sees the member
 *    row locally (its deferred `MemberExists` reads the live local table). Done only once
 *    the binding is in place AND nothing is staged; a binding written while a burn keeps
 *    being refused leaves the loop live to settle the invitation later.
 *
 * ## Stops, and re-arming
 *
 * Two kinds of stop. A RE-ARMABLE stop is one a fresh invitation should reopen:
 *
 * - **Done** (above).
 * - **Self-revoked with nothing staged** (step 1 above).
 *
 * A PERMANENT stop is one a fresh invitation changes nothing about — {@link rearm} is a
 * no-op after it:
 *
 * - **Sealed strand**: `consumeInvite` rejected by `ConsumedInvite.NotSealed` — nobody
 *   can ever be admitted, so retrying forever is noise. Terminal-with-log.
 * - **Undecodable party key**: nothing can be signed; loud log, stop.
 * - **The public {@link stop}**: `StrandInstanceManager.releaseRuntime` and
 *   `clearOwnMemberPeerBinding` both call it and mean it — the latter stops the loop and
 *   awaits {@link settle} precisely so no pass can re-register the binding it is about to
 *   delete, and a re-arm that restarted the loop would undo that.
 *
 * `CadreNode.adoptFormationMembershipInvite` stages every fresh invitation and notifies
 * the instance manager, which calls {@link rearm}: a done loop reopens and runs one pass
 * at once; a running loop is merely kicked. This is what lets a party that was REMOVED
 * from the strand, and then handed a new invitation, actually attempt it — the loop
 * finished during its first join, long before the removal.
 *
 * On a removed party the local replica is usually stale: the cohort cut this machine off
 * at about the moment the removal was written, so `isStrandMember` still answers true and
 * a re-armed pass lands in the already-member arm. That is why the burn arm keeps a
 * refused invitation staged and why the done state requires nothing staged — otherwise
 * the fresh credential would be dropped on the first refused burn and the loop would latch
 * done again, with the only trace a debug line.
 *
 * A DEAD invitation that is not terminal for the loop — expired, cancelled, or already
 * consumed by someone else (`ConsumedInvite`'s primary key) — is dropped with a log and
 * the loop keeps idling: a fresh formation stages a new invitation, and a manager-side
 * admission (`addMemberByManager`) seats the member row without one.
 *
 * ## Reporting a blocked re-join
 *
 * Redeeming (or burning) writes into the strand, and the machines that would carry that
 * write are exactly the ones the remaining members refuse once this party is removed. So
 * the attempt is expected to fail, and the failure is REPORTED rather than left to the
 * ladder: one `console.warn` plus the {@link StrandMembershipReconcilerDeps.onRejoinBlocked}
 * callback (`CadreNode`'s `strand:rejoin-blocked` event), at most once per re-arm cycle.
 * Two triggers:
 *
 * - **Confirmed** — a pass finds this party self-revoked AND an invitation staged. The node
 *   knows it was removed and is holding a credential it cannot spend.
 * - **Probable** — {@link UNFINISHED_PASSES_BEFORE_ESCALATION} consecutive attempted passes
 *   left the invitation staged. The case that matters most in the field: a removed party
 *   that never learned it was removed (the removal did not replicate here before the cut).
 *   It is a suspicion, not a verdict — the invitation's `Invite` row may simply not have
 *   replicated here yet — and the warning names both causes.
 *
 * The remedy in either case is a remaining manager admitting this party's member key
 * directly (`addMemberByManager`): that lifts the refusal, replication resumes, and the
 * still-running loop sees the member row, burns the leftover credential and finishes by
 * itself.
 *
 * ## Sharing the database with the app
 *
 * The strand `Database` this loop writes to is the one the app holds. Every write here
 * passes `joinOpenTransaction: false`, so it runs as a transaction of its own and never
 * joins one the app has open: the writer refuses with `StrandTransactionBusyError`, having
 * written nothing, and the pass retries on the ladder. A busy refusal is never read as a
 * dead invitation, and a busy burn leaves the invitation staged for the next pass.
 *
 * ## Half-committed join
 *
 * On a networked strand optimystic commits `Member` and `ConsumedInvite` as separate
 * collections and can report that only some of them were saved (`CoordinatorPartialCommitError`,
 * or the plugin's legacy `PartialCommitError`). When `ConsumedInvite` is saved and `Member` is
 * not, the invitation is spent and the schema seats a `Member` through an invitation only in the
 * same transaction as a fresh consumption, so this loop can never seat the party from it. Such a
 * failure is recognised by TYPE before any message text is read (its message names the
 * `ConsumedInvite` collection, which a text match once mistook for a dead invitation), reported
 * with ONE `console.warn`, and the invitation is dropped. The loop keeps running like it does
 * after a dead invitation: a manager admission, or a `Member` row that did land, is picked up by
 * the next pass, which then writes the binding. Whether sereus should repair such a join itself
 * is `blocked/strand-half-committed-join-recovery`.

/**
 * Control-network push-wake transport.
 *
 * Lets a same-cadre peer — typically an always-on server that participates in a
 * strand and sees new activity — signal a hibernating cadre peer to bring that
 * strand online, pull pending activity, and re-hibernate. Push-wake travels the
 * **control network** (the per-party network connecting this party's own cadre
 * nodes), which is the only network a hibernating peer keeps connected.
 *
 * Modeled directly on `seed-bootstrap.ts`: a dedicated libp2p protocol id,
 * 4-byte big-endian length-prefixed JSON frames, `node.handle` for the receiver,
 * `node.dialProtocol` for the sender, and the shared `ControlStream` primitives
 * from `control-stream.ts`. The exchange is a single request → single ack on one
 * stream (like seed delivery), so each side reads to EOF (under a read timeout)
 * and decodes one frame via the shared {@link decodeLengthPrefixedFrame} guard.
 *
 * **Authorization (v1):** a wake is low-risk — it only causes the receiver to
 * spend resources coming online for a strand it already participates in — so the
 * receiver carries no per-request signature and instead defers entirely to the
 * injected `isMember` predicate. `CadreNode` injects its AUTHORIZED-membership
 * predicate there (`isAuthorizedMember`: the sender's `CadrePeer` row must carry
 * a voucher that verifies against an owner key in the receiver's node-local
 * trusted-owner anchor), so a peer that merely published rows into the replicated
 * control DB is refused. This module stays agnostic: it enforces whatever
 * predicate it is given.

 * still gets a genuine try at its direct one; a peer needing longer than that is
 * not "asleep and reachable", which is the only case a wake is for. The last
 * attempt inside the budget gets whatever remains of it, so the call returns at
 * the budget, not past it.

 * needed and none should be assumed, and two different keys are two different names
 * even on a filesystem that ignores case (Windows, macOS). Do not parse it;
 * `controlStorageScope` / `isControlStorageScope` (`storage-scope.ts`) are the supported
 * way to mint and recognize the control key. The control key holds the charset by
 * lowercase hex encoding;
 * a strand's key — its strand id, which may have replicated in from another node in
 * the party — holds it because `StrandInstanceManager.startStrand` runs
 * `assertStrandScopeKey` on every launch and refuses a strand that fails it.
 *
 * **Called once per scope per runtime lifetime.** The scopes are the control database
 * (once per `CadreNode.start()`) and each strand id (once per `startStrand`).
 * Hibernation — `quiesceStrand` then `resumeStrand` — reuses the store already
 * resolved for that strand and does NOT re-enter this callback.
 *
 * **The control scope is party-specific.** It is `controlStorageScope(partyId)`, not a
 * fixed string, because the control database holds one party's own records — its
 * strands, owner keys, peers, invitations, revocations. Two parties on one device ask
 * for two different keys and MUST get two different stores, or a node started for one
 * party reads the other's rows as its own.
 *
 * It IS re-entered for a scope after that scope's runtime has stopped
 * (`stopStrand`, or a `stop()` then `start()` cycle on one `CadreNode`), so it must
 * be able to hand back a store over the same durable backend a second time. A
 * factory may mint a fresh object per call; it must not *need* to.
 *
 * cadre-core disposes only its own cache wrapper — it never closes the store you
 * returned. Closing the underlying handle stays the embedder's job.
 *
 * **The single-instance form shares data across scopes by construction** — one store
 * for every strand AND for every party's control database. An embedder that can serve
 * more than one party must use the factory form. One instance handed to every scope
 * also shares ONE cache wrapper (`wrapStorageWithCache` memoizes per inner instance),
 * which counts its holders: a scope stopping releases only its own claim, and the
 * wrapper is retired when the last scope releases it. The factory form is the better
 * default for the further reason that it partitions each strand's data, which

/**
 * The connection-monitor settings every cadre node runs with when
 * {@link NetworkConfig.connectionMonitor} is unset: a 30 second ping deadline in place
 * of libp2p's 5 second one, and a 35 second gap between pings so a ping is never
 * outstanding when the next one starts.
 *
 * WHY this is a default and not opt-in. libp2p's monitor pings every connection and,
 * with its own `abortConnectionOnPingFailure: true`, aborts the connection on the FIRST
 * timeout. A peer whose event loop is saturated by pure-JS Noise crypto — a slow phone
 * under React Native, see {@link NetworkConfig.noiseCrypto} — misses that deadline while
 * perfectly healthy; the other end aborts, the peer redials, and the new handshake
 * saturates it further. Measured on gotchoices/sereus#13 at a Galaxy S7's crypto cost, a
 * two-party bring-up failed 3 of 3 runs on stock settings, with 30 `aborting connection
 * due to ping failure` entries in the relay's log for one run, and passed 4 of 4 in about
 * 90 seconds once the deadline was widened on every node. The monitor runs on BOTH ends
 * of a connection and either end's abort closes it for both, so a setting the phone alone
 * applies does not cover the peer dropping it. That is what rules out scoping this to
 * React Native.
 *
 * WHY `pingInterval` MOVES WITH THE DEADLINE, and is not left at libp2p's 10 seconds.
 * The monitor opens a ping stream per connection per interval whether or not the previous
 * ping has answered, and `/ipfs/ping/1.0.0` is registered by `@libp2p/ping` with
 * `maxOutboundStreams: 1`. A second concurrent ping stream on one connection therefore
 * fails in `Connection.newStream` with `TooManyOutboundProtocolStreamsError`, which
 * reaches the monitor's own catch and aborts the connection exactly as a timeout does. A
 * widened deadline alone is thus capped by the ping interval: measured against two local
 * libp2p 3.1.3 nodes whose ping handler answered 600ms late, an interval of 300ms with a
 * 900ms deadline aborted the connection, while a 900ms interval with the same deadline
 * kept it (the same pair aborted at a 200ms stall only when the deadline was 300ms). An
 * interval strictly above the deadline is what makes the 30 seconds real.
 *
 * WHAT THE LINK NEEDS OF IT. One ping opens a fresh stream and echoes over it: a protocol
 * negotiation plus the echo, two link round trips by `link-budget.ts`'s counts (a `newStream`
 * over a relayed circuit measured 3016 ms at 1500 ms one-way). At the slowest link sereus
 * supports, a 3-second relayed round trip, that is about 6 s — well inside the 30 s deadline,
 * which exists for the phone's CPU rather than the link.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS. A dead peer is reclaimed 30 to 65 seconds after it stops answering — the
 * deadline, plus up to one interval of waiting for the ping that will fail — where
 * libp2p's defaults took about 5 to 15 seconds. `db-p2p` caps a node at 16 connections,
 * so the worst case is those slots held about a minute longer than before; at that scale
 * it is not a starvation risk.
 *
 * WHY THE DEADLINE IS PINNED rather than given room to adapt. `pingTimeout` is an
 * adaptive-timeout init, and equal `minTimeout`/`maxTimeout` clamp it to one value on
 * every libp2p version. Under libp2p 3.1.3, which sereus resolves today, it is already
 * flat at `minTimeout`: `ConnectionMonitor` asks its `AdaptiveTimeout` for a deadline but
 * never calls `cleanUp` to report how long the ping took, so the moving average the
 * deadline derives from stays at zero. libp2p 3.3 does report ping durations back, and a
 * ceiling above `pingInterval` would then let the deadline grow past the interval and put
 * the overlapping-ping abort above straight back. Pinning both ends keeps the interval's
 * margin true on the version bump instead of making it something to remember. It also
 * sidesteps 3.3's other surprise: the monitor keeps one `AdaptiveTimeout` for all of a
 * node's connections, so one slow peer would otherwise lengthen the deadline for every
 * connection on that node.

     * (register a config + `addStrand`, e.g. via a chat `joinChatStrand` helper).
     * Carries the full {@link StrandRow} so the app can join without re-querying

     *
     * Also emitted for a strand this node joined from ANOTHER party, which no control

     * with `FounderOwnerKey: null` carrying the closed strand's `MemberPrivateKey`. That
     * row is the product of the formation's consent, so claiming it needs no second one.
     *
     * **Fired once per strand per session, and it can fire before your listener is
     * attached.** The strand watcher's first poll runs inside `CadreNode.start()`
     * (100 ms after the watcher starts), so every strand already stored for this
     * party is normally offered while the embedding app is still inside its own
     * `start()` await. The watcher then records the strand as seen and no later poll
     * re-offers it, so a listener attached a moment late misses those strands for the
     * life of the process.
     *
     * One exception, and it does NOT produce a second event: when an `addStrand` that
     * claims a discovered strand FAILS, the watcher is told to forget the strand so a
     * later poll retries it. That claim left the sApp config registered, so the retry
     * takes the auto-launch branch — what the app sees is `strand:error` per failed
     * retry and `strand:started` when one succeeds.
     *
     * So an app that auto-joins discovered strands must **subscribe first, then
     * drain `CadreNode.getDiscoveredStrands()`** — the map of strands no local
     * config claims. In that order a strand discovered between the two steps is

     * be idempotent (guard on an in-flight set, not only on
     * `getStrands().has(id)` — the strand manager tracks an instance only once
     * `addStrand` has resolved).
     *
     * On a node that hosts storage replicas ({@link CadreNodeConfig.hostUnclaimedStrands},
     * the default for `profile: 'storage'`) the event still fires once, and the node launches
     * the strand as a replica right after it — so there `getStrands().has(id)` soon turns
     * true for a strand no app has claimed; an unclaimed instance has no `sAppInfo`. A

/**
 * Control-cohort dial selection: the pure policy behind

 * node proactively dials each pass to keep the `CadreControl` collections' cohort
 * connected (and thus replicating), without devolving into an N² mesh.
 *
 * FRET only needs a *connected* graph with the block clusters reachable, not a
 * full mesh. Storage/owner nodes are the stable, publicly-dialable backbone
 * that hold the control blocks, so the policy is **backbone-preferential with a
 * bounded out-degree**:
 *
 * - **Always dial every backbone (owner) member** — the owner set is
 *   small by design, and routing cohort formation through publicly-dialable
 *   owner nodes keeps the cohort ≥2 where owner-signed writes originate.
 * - **Fill the remainder** up to `targetDegree` with non-owner members,
 *   ordered deterministically (peerId sort) so every node makes the same stable
 *   choice across passes and load spreads predictably.
 *
 * For a small party (members ≤ degree) this degenerates to a full mesh, which is
 * correct, cheap, and matches what the convergence tests do by hand; for a large
 * party it bounds out-degree to `backbone + targetDegree`.

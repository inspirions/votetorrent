// Peer-join whole-store block catch-up, shared by the STRAND networks and the CONTROL
// network. On a new peer's `peer:identify` result — libp2p's identify protocol runs once per
// connection and reports the protocols the remote supports — naming this network's own
// block-transfer protocol, it schedules a debounced push of every committed, materialized
// block in the local raw store to that peer, so a machine that joined after blocks were
// committed still ends up physically holding them. Optimystic has no cohort-join catch-up
// of its own; a block committed while its writer was alone has exactly one holder forever
// without this (named collection-header blocks are written once, at collection creation,
// and their revision never moves again — so no later commit ever carries them anywhere).
//
// A peer whose identify does not name the protocol — a bare circuit relay, a bootstrap node,
// or (on the control network) a stranger the inbound gate admits without membership — is
// never scheduled at all: it cannot receive anything, since the protocol id is namespaced per
// network and the dial would simply fail. Before this filter existed, such a peer WAS
// scheduled, failed every dial, and after `PEER_JOIN_BACKFILL_WARN_AFTER_FAILURES` produced a
// `console.warn` naming it — gotchoices/sereus#18 is two relay-only parties restarting and
// printing exactly that warning about their own relay, forever, on every reconnect. See
// {@link speaksBlockTransfer}.
//
// NOTE: this copies the WHOLE local store to every newly connected peer, which is right
// while a network is one party's handful of machines (see docs/architecture.md →
// Replication cluster size — the control network replicates to the whole party by intent,
// and "On a strand, the machine count is not a party count"). If these meshes ever get
// large, filter the pushed set by FRET cohort responsibility for each block id instead of
// pushing everything.
//
// NOTE: this lives in cadre-core only because `../optimystic` is read-only from this repo.
// If Optimystic ever grows a cohort-join catch-up of its own, delete this module rather
// than running two.
//
// Membership — the one place the two networks differ, expressed as the optional
// `authorizePeer` dep:
//
// - STRAND networks pass none. Anything that speaks the strand's own block-transfer protocol
//   already receives cohort replicas of new commits, so pushing older blocks to it exposes
//   nothing new; adding a gate would diverge from what ordinary replication already does
//   there.
// - The CONTROL network MUST pass one, because that argument does not carry over: its
//   inbound connection gate deliberately admits non-members in several states (an
//   un-enrolled node taking its seed, an open enrollment window, an outstanding
//   invitation, configured bootstrap/relay peers — see docs/architecture.md, the
//   control-network inbound connection gate). Pushing the whole control store to such a
//   peer would hand a stranger the party's entire membership, addresses and strand list.
//   `CadreNode` passes `isAuthorizedMember`; the gate is consulted at PUSH time, not at
//   schedule time, and fails closed on a thrown check. A denied run is not memoized, so
//   the peer is retried on its next `peer:identify` (a reconnect re-runs identify) — or
//   sooner, via `scheduleConnectedPeers()` on a membership change (the production join order is
//   connect-then-authorize, so the denial at dial time is the expected first pass).
//
// Both per-push deadlines are DERIVED from the declared link round trip
// (`link-budget.ts`), not fixed milliseconds. That is not tuning — it is what makes this
// module work at all over a relay. Opening a relayed connection costs a fixed number of
// exchanges, so the 3000 ms this catch-up used to allow its dial could never finish one
// above 375 ms of one-way link delay: the catch-up existed so that a machine which joined
// after blocks were committed physically ends up holding them, and through a relay on any
// link slow enough to matter it had never once managed to. The reproduction is
// `packages/integration-tests/src/scenarios/relayed-dial-cost-by-latency.integration.ts`.
//
// It does NOT work at every speed. Above the declared link, libp2p's own dial and
// inbound-upgrade limits — derived from the same declaration — abandon the connection before
// any deadline here is consulted, and the listener's one makes that failure look like an absent
// peer rather than a timeout. That is also what happens when the machine being caught up
// declared a FASTER link than this one, since its limit is the listener's. See
// `link-budget.ts` ("libp2p's own two limits", "What still fails at the supported link").
//
// RETRY, and why it backs off. A run whose PUSH FAILED — the transport threw, which is what
// a dial or response deadline expiring looks like here — re-arms on a doubling backoff
// (`retryBackoffMs` to `maxRetryBackoffMs`), and a `peer:identify` arriving while that wait
// is outstanding is DROPPED rather than collapsing it back to the debounce. Both halves are
// load-bearing:
//
// - Without the re-arm, a transient push failure over a stable connection left the peer
//   partially copied until its next reconnect (read repair still covered reads meanwhile).
// - Without dropping churn inside the wait, a peer that cannot be reached at all is
//   re-dialled on every `peer:identify` forever. That is not hypothetical: the 2026-09-26
//   relayed reproduction shows one peer re-opening a connection about every 14.5 s for a
//   200-second run, each event starting a catch-up whose dial could not possibly finish.
//   The connection kept re-appearing because Optimystic's own block-transfer push path
//   budgets its dial at `transferTimeoutMs ?? 30000` — the one dial budget in the stack
//   above the measured relayed setup cost — so it succeeded where this one could not.
//
// A NON-CLEAN run is NOT on its own enough to re-arm, and the distinction is what keeps the
// backoff from becoming a worse problem than the one it fixes. `clean` also goes false for
// outcomes no amount of retrying can change: the membership gate DENIED the peer; this
// network's raw storage implements no `listBlockIds`, so the catch-up is inert; or the
// receiver reported blocks in `missing`, which it does per block for a payload it cannot
// parse and for a revision whose retained commit proof this node does not hold (a push
// carrying no proof is refused outright by a receiver running the default
// `requirePushCertificate: true`, and an unretained proof is the ordinary case — see
// {@link Chunk.proofs}). Re-arming on those would re-push the WHOLE store to that peer every
// `maxRetryBackoffMs` for as long as the node runs, and report the failure below as a link
// budget problem when nothing about the link is wrong. All three still leave the peer
// un-memoized, so its next `peer:identify` retries — the behaviour that predates the
// backoff, and the right one for a verdict rather than a timeout. Denial in particular is
// re-driven on purpose by `scheduleConnectedPeers()` the moment the membership commit lands,
// because the control network's join order is connect-then-authorize.
//
// A re-arm is also skipped when the peer is no longer CONNECTED. This module's trigger is
// `peer:identify`, so a peer that went away already has one: re-arming instead would leave
// a machine dialing a peer it cannot see once a minute for the rest of its uptime.
//
// After `PEER_JOIN_BACKFILL_WARN_AFTER_FAILURES` consecutive failures one `console.warn`
// names the peer and the budget, because otherwise a machine on a too-slow link says
// nothing at all: the connection simply never appears and only a DEBUG log mentions a dial
// timeout.
//
// NOTE: the protocol check happens once — either when a connection's `peer:identify` fires,
// or, for a peer already connected when this instance starts, when `scheduleConnectedPeers()`
// reads its protocols back from the peer store — and is never repeated once a peer is
// scheduled. A peer that stops speaking the protocol after being scheduled (should that ever
// happen) is not de-scheduled; `runCatchUp`'s own unreachable-peer bail is what would catch
// that case instead. `peer:identify` also fires on every identify-push from a connected peer
// (address or protocol changes), which only re-enters the debounce — cheap, and dropped
// outright for caught-up peers and peers inside a backoff wait.
//
// NOTE: a same-network peer whose identify never completes on a connection (the identify
// stream times out over a slow relayed link, say) is not caught up until a later identify
// succeeds — a reconnect, an identify-push, or on the control network a membership-change
// re-drive. Accepted: every db-p2p node runs identify, and read repair still covers reads
// meanwhile; if relayed links ever routinely outlast identify's timeout, raise that timeout
// in the node builder rather than scheduling unidentified peers here.
//
// NOTE: a peer that disconnects INSIDE a backoff wait still costs the one attempt that wait
// was already armed for — the connectivity check is made when the re-arm is decided, not when
// the timer fires, and this module subscribes to `peer:identify` only. One dial, not a
// recurring one; if a node ever holds many transient peers, subscribe to `connection:close`
// and clear the pending timer there.

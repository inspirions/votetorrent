 *
 * Why each term:
 *
 * - **awaitContact**: the listener's handler starts when it answers the protocol
 *   negotiation; the answer reaches the joiner and the contact frame comes back, one round
 *   trip, budgeted as a request over an open stream (2) for the same headroom as every other
 *   one-exchange read in `link-budget.ts`.
 * - **validation** and the reads inside **provisionWork** are budgeted at two consulting
 *   reads each, not one per read the code issues. What actually runs: validation is three
 *   control reads (`isTokenValid` reads the invite; `isTokenUsed` reads it again and counts
 *   its usages) plus whatever the disclosure validator does; the bound provisioning path
 *   (`StrandFormationManager.provisionAsResponder`) reads the invite and the strand row to
 *   resolve the host strand, the invite again, the approver's `ValidationKey` and the seat
 *   count around the outside approval hook (an HTTP call, so its own
 *   `DEFAULT_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS` is link-independent and added flat), the strand row and its
 *   `StrandPartyKey` to issue the joiner's membership invite, and the host strand's stamp
 *   before the `FormationUsage` write; then one strand-database commit issues the invite.
 *   Every one of those is a read of this party's own control database, which in steady state
 *   touches held blocks and consults nobody (`cadre-consistency.md` → "Deadlines Over
 *   Optimystic's Reads and Commits"), so `R` is charged as headroom for the ones that do
 *   consult, not per read. Waking a hibernating host strand inside the issue is NOT counted
 *   either: `wakeHostStrandForFormation` cuts it off by design with a retryable rejection
 *   and leaves the wake running, so the joiner's retry finds the strand live.
 *   NOTE: if formation is seen timing out while the responder's control reads are consulting
 *   the cohort (a cold responder, a control database not yet converged), charge one `R` per
 *   read here rather than raising the flat headroom; the joiner is told 'Formation
 *   provisioning timed out' with its invite unspent, so the cost is a retry, not a spent
 *   invite.
 * - **provisionGrace**: the window it exists for opens when the `FormationUsage` insert
 *   attempt passes its abort check. `ControlDatabase.redeemInvitation` and
 *   `recordFormationUsage` check the signal once per attempt inside the write lock, then run
 *   the seat read (`assertSeatRemains`) and the transaction, so the grace contains one read
 *   plus one commit. A retry after a failed attempt re-checks the abort, so only one attempt
 *   needs containing.
 * - **responseTravelMargin**: half a round trip out, half back, plus the validation reads,
 *   which run on the initiator's await-response clock but before the responder's
 *   provisioning clock starts.
 * - **session**: the initiator's dial plus its await-response. The responder's whole path
 *   (awaitContact + validation + work + grace = 10 000 + 52L) is inside it at every L.
 *
 * Ordering, strict at every L > 0, and pinned by `strand-formation-deadlines.spec.ts`:
 * approval hook < provisionWork < work + grace < initiatorAwaitResponse < session, and the
 * responder's whole path < session. Each layer can therefore fail and report before the
 * layer above it gives up, and the work budget always outlasts the hook's own timeout, so a
 * dead hook reports 'Formation approval unavailable, retry' rather than racing a
 * provisioning timeout.
 *
 * **What this costs.** At the default declaration (3 500 ms) a joiner whose responder
 * accepts the contact and then hangs waits up to 188.5 s, about three minutes, before it is
 * told, where the fixed ladder this replaced told it after 15 s; the whole session is
 * bounded at 208 s. A responder that is unreachable still fails at the dial, 19.5 s. A host
 * that knows its party is on a fast link lowers `linkRoundTripMs` and gets roughly the old
 * numbers back (at L = 100: dial 2.5 s, provisioning 14.6 s, await-response 15.1 s, session
 * 17.6 s). Before this derivation, the fixed 5 s dial could not open a relayed connection
 * above a 1.25-second round trip, and the fixed 2 s grace could not contain one commit at the
 * supported link, so a joiner could be told 'timed out' over an invite that was in fact
 * spent.

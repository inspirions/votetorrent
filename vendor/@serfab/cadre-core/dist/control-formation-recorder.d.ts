/**
 * {@link FormationUsageRecorder} backed by the real `CadreControl` tables.
 *
 * It reads `FormationInvite` / `FormationUsage` to answer token-validity and
 * usage questions, and writes the consent row that records a redemption. Two
 * provisioning shapes are supported, keyed on whether the invite binds a host strand:
 *
 * - **Bound (provision-then-record):** the host strand already exists (owner-signed
 *   up front and named by the invite's `StrandId`), so {@link resolveStrand} reports it
 *   and {@link authorizeUsage} then its `record()` (or {@link recordUsage}, both at once)
 *   writes the consent row against that pre-existing strand
 *   (record-only) rather than inserting a new `Strand`.
 * - **Unbound (responder-provisions):** the invite carries no `StrandId`, so
 *   {@link provisionAndRecord} mints a fresh strand and records consent against it
 *   ATOMICALLY (one `FormationUsage` row), closing the single-use hole the older
 *   never-record fallback left open.
 *
 * This replaces the in-memory stubs used by the formation tests so the consent path
 * is exercised against the persisted control network.
 *
 * Usage accounting follows the schema's `FormationUsage.Authorized` semantics:
 * a null `TotalUses` means unlimited uses; otherwise the invite is "used up"
 * once the recorded usage count reaches `TotalUses`.
 *
 * When the invite carries a `ValidationUrl`, both write paths first obtain an outside
 * approval ({@link obtainApproval}) — the recorder is the one place where the nonce that is
 * SIGNED and the nonce that is INSERTED are trivially the same value, since it also performs
 * the write. That makes this class do network I/O; failures surface as
 * {@link FormationApprovalError}s the manager maps to protocol rejection reasons. The bound
 * path is split in two ({@link authorizeUsage}, then the returned `record()`) so the manager
 * can issue the joiner's membership pass between the approval and the write; the handle
 * carries the approved fields across, which keeps the signed and inserted nonce the same.

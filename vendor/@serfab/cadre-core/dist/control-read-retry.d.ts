/**
 * Bounded retry for TRANSIENT control-read failures — the classifier and policy behind
 * `ControlDatabase.readRows`, the single funnel every control read passes through.
 *
 * Why this exists: control WRITES have absorbed transient cluster failures since
 * `control-write-retry.ts` landed, but a read had no second chance — one stream reset
 * during a scan ended the read outright (measured: a rigged single `eval` failure killed
 * `queryRevokedStamps` after exactly one attempt while the same injection against `exec`
 * was absorbed). This module gives reads the same bounded re-presentation with a SHORTER
 * deadline and a NARROWER failure set, because the tightest caller deadline over a control
 * read is the inbound admission gate's 2 s fail-open timeout
 * (`ADMISSION_DECISION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `link-budget.ts`) — a read budget that
 * does not fit inside it with headroom spends its retries after the gate has already
 * admitted.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT "the write classifier minus its commit veto" — the retriable
 * set differs in both directions (see {@link isRetriableControlReadFailure}). The loop
 * lives in `control-retry.ts`, shared with the write policy; this module owns only the
 * read policy. And like the write side, the retry classifies by TEXT. That was forced when
 * it was written — optimystic's scan path used to rethrow `new Error('Query failed: ' +
 * message)` with no `cause` — and is no longer: `OptimysticVirtualTable` now rethrows
 * through `rewrapAsQueryError` (`quereus-plugin-optimystic/src/optimystic-module.ts`),
 * which keeps the typed `BlockUnavailableError` on `cause`, and Quereus wraps that as
 * `Error during query on table '<T>': …`, again preserving `cause`
 * (`quereus/src/runtime/emit/scan.ts`). The text matchers still work because every wrap
 * embeds the inner message. Every matcher fails CLOSED — an upstream rewording stops the
 * retry engaging, it never makes it unsafe. {@link isCohortUnreachableRead}, which is not a
 * retry classifier, matches by type.

/**
 * Attempts allowed per control read: the first, plus two retries. Attempts are cheap here —
 * the observed transient failure (the transactor's read-phase aggregate off a stream still
 * forming) surfaces in ~25 ms — and {@link CONTROL_READ_RETRY_BUDGET_MS} is what terminates
 * the loop when an attempt is slow instead.

 * Backoff before read retry N, jittered ±50% and capped at the largest base by the shared

 * whole loop must fit under {@link CONTROL_READ_RETRY_BUDGET_MS}; the spec pins that

/**
 * Elapsed-time ceiling on the whole read-retry loop, checked after a failed attempt BEFORE
 * sleeping — so one slow attempt (e.g. a `cohort-unreachable` read that burned the
 * transactor's own deadline) terminates the loop rather than compounding.
 *
 * 1500 ms, sized against `ADMISSION_DECISION_TIMEOUT_MS` (2000 ms): the inbound admission
 * gate reads the control DB and is FAIL-OPEN on both throw and timeout, so a read that
 * outlives the gate's deadline spends its retries after the gate has already admitted an
 * unplaced peer. Under the deadline, a read that succeeds on its second attempt lets the
 * gate make the real decision instead. `control-read-retry.spec.ts` asserts the
 * relationship so a future edit to either constant reddens instead of silently
 * reintroducing the fail-open admit. NOTE: `queryCadrePeers` / `queryPeerRecord` each
 * issue TWO network reads (the revoked-stamp filter plus the row scan) and the budget is
 * per read, so a membership read can spend up to two budgets back to back — still inside
 * 2 s only because each stays well under it. Do not raise these numbers without
 * re-checking against `ADMISSION_DECISION_TIMEOUT_MS`.
 *
 * It cuts the loop off by design, so it does not grow with the link or with the number that
 * dominates a slow attempt: an attempt whose cohort consult finds a silent peer costs
 * `clusterPolicy.cohortQueryTimeoutMs`, two link round trips at the declared link
 * (`cohortReadDeadlineMs` in `link-budget.ts`, 7 000 ms at the default declaration; the plugin's
 * `COHORT_READ_DEADLINE_MS` is the same number). That is more than four times this budget, so
 * such an attempt is never retried and the caller gets its error unchanged. That is deliberate:
 * the caller this budget is sized for, the admission gate, has
 * already taken its fail-open answer by then, and a retry would only spend time after it. What
 * the budget still buys is the fast failures it was built for: the ~25 ms transactor read-phase
 * aggregate off a stream still forming, and a `cohort-unreachable` read during bring-up, which
 * fails fast because there is no connection to ask. Both retry twice well inside 1500 ms. See
 * `docs/cadre-consistency.md` → "Deadlines Over Optimystic's Reads and Commits".

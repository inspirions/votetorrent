/**
 * Shared control-network stream primitives.
 *
 * The cadre control protocols — seed delivery (`seed-bootstrap.ts`), push-wake
 * (`strand-wake-protocol.ts`), and strand formation (`strand-formation-protocol.ts`)
 * — all speak 4-byte big-endian length-prefixed JSON frames over a libp2p 3.x
 * stream. This module lifts the previously-triplicated stream shape, frame
 * writer, and `withTimeout` wrapper into one place, and adds a timeout-bounded,
 * abort-on-timeout read-to-EOF helper so a misbehaving peer that opens a stream
 * and never half-closes its write end cannot pin a receiver forever.
 *
 * The sender side of all three protocols is the same exchange — dial under a
 * deadline, write one frame, half-close, read one response, reset the stream on
 * any failure — so that shape lives here too, as {@link withDeadline} +
 * {@link exchangeFrame}; each protocol supplies only its dial options, its
 * request object, and its response decoder. The receiver's half — one reply
 * frame, then close — is {@link replyAndClose}.
 *
 * Dependency-free by design: it imports nothing from the protocol modules, so
 * the import graph stays acyclic (`control-stream` ← `seed-bootstrap` ←
 * `strand-wake-protocol`). In particular it returns RAW bytes from
 * {@link readStreamToEnd} rather than decoding a frame — callers own the
 * `decodeLengthPrefixedFrame` guard.

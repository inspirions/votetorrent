/**
 * Node-local, NON-replicated **strand peer book**: for each strand this node runs,
 * the strand peers it knows an address for — the other parties' strand transport
 * peers, learned at formation and observed on every connection — with their
 * last-known strand-network addresses and when this node last held a connection
 * to them. Read on every launch, hibernation resume and periodic address refresh,
 * so a machine that restarts dials the peers it was talking to BEFORE it does
 * anything else, instead of coming back up alone.
 *
 * Why it exists (gotchoices/sereus#18): a cross-party strand learned the other
 * party's strand addresses exactly once, at formation, into an in-memory map, and
 * the strand-addr RPC answers own-party siblings only. After a restart neither
 * relay-only party had any address for the other: the FRET ring and the Optimystic
 * cohort each held only self, the strand reported `active`, local writes
 * succeeded, nothing replicated.
 *
 * NOTE: interim, to be replaced (maintainer decision, 2026-09-28). FRET's
 * `plan/10-feat-address-hints-in-neighbor-exchange` carries signed peer records in
 * its neighbour exchange and its saved routing table. Once a FRET release with it
 * reaches `@optimystic/db-p2p`, remove this book and the swap and pass db-p2p
 * `persistence` for strand nodes instead; `blocked/retire-strand-peer-book-for-fret-address-hints`
 * tracks that.
 *
 * NOTE: accepted design boundary (maintainer decision, 2026-09-27) — this is a
 * per-machine record in the machine's own storage, NOT a registry inside the
 * strand database. An in-strand registry (`Strand.MemberPeer` rows carrying
 * addresses) would let a member reach peers it has never connected to while they
 * are offline; nothing needs that today, and it is ruled out for now. Revisit only
 * if a case needs addresses to reach members that are offline.
 *
 * Three implementations mirroring `bootstrap-peer-store.ts` (read that first —
 * same "must outlive the process, storage differs per platform" problem, both
 * persistent forms share `node-local-snapshot.ts`):
 *  - {@link MemoryStrandPeerBookStore} (this module, cross-platform) — ephemeral;
 *    the default when no store is injected via `CadreNodeConfig.strandPeers`. A
 *    node using it is exactly the pre-#18 shape after a restart.
 *  - {@link PersistentStrandPeerBookStore} (this module, cross-platform) — durable
 *    over any `DurableSlot` the embedding app supplies.
 *  - `FileStrandPeerBookStore` — the above over a Node file in the node's state
 *    directory; Node-only, behind the subpath
 *    `@serfab/cadre-core/strand-peer-book-file` (same isolation pattern as
 *    `bootstrap-peer-store-file`) so `node:fs` never lands in the RN/browser graph.
 *
 * One store per NODE holding every strand, rather than one slot per strand: the
 * snapshot machinery writes one slot whole, and a node runs a handful of strands
 * with at most {@link MAX_STRAND_PEERS} peers each — a few KB. The embedder
 * therefore wires one slot, like the other node-local stores.
 *
 * **Nothing here is trust-bearing.** An address grants no authority: the dialed
 * peer authenticates by peer id at the handshake, and every address is bound to
 * the peer id it is filed under (see {@link StrandPeerEntry.addrs}), so a dial
 * cannot be redirected to whoever answers. A junk address costs one failed dial per
 * launch until it ages out or the peer's next connection replaces the entry. What a
 * persistent backend's loader DOES owe is dropping structurally junk entries rather
 * than carrying them into the dial loop.

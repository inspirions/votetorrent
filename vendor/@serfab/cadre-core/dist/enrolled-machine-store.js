/**
 * Node-local, NON-replicated record of how many machines this party had enrolled
 * the last time this node looked — the block-repair corroboration yardstick the
 * CONTROL network declares when its libp2p node is built.
 *
 * ## Why the number has to be remembered rather than read
 *
 * `resolveRepairYardstick` (in `@serfab/quereus-plugin-sereus`'s `cluster-size.ts`
 * — read it first; the arithmetic and both clamps are explained there and are not
 * repeated here) derives the yardstick from the machines that SERVE the network being
 * configured. For the CONTROL network that is the machines enrolled in the party, and
 * exactly so: every enrolled machine runs the control node by construction. (It is NOT
 * the right number for a strand, which runs on a subset — see
 * `StartStrandConfig.servingMachines`. This store is control-network-only, and that
 * scope is a safety property, not an accident.) Optimystic freezes a network's
 * `clusterPolicy` when its libp2p node is built and offers no runtime setter, so the
 * number has to be known at construction time.
 *
 * The control node cannot read it when it needs it. `CadreNode.buildControlNodeOptions`
 * runs inside `start()` BEFORE `createControlNode()`, which is before the
 * `ControlDatabase` holding the `CadrePeer` rows exists — so at the one moment the
 * number is needed, nothing can answer. That deadlock is why the control network
 * declared no yardstick at all and ran at `CONTROL_CLUSTER_POLICY`'s
 * `assumedClusterSize` of 2.
 *
 * This store breaks it the only way a chicken-and-egg is broken: by remembering
 * across the restart. `CadreNode.refreshAuthorizedControlPeers` records the count
 * every time membership is recomputed; `CadreNode.start()` reads it back before the
 * control node is built. A node therefore declares what it last knew, and a party
 * that grows applies the larger number on each node's NEXT launch. Raising the
 * yardstick is the safe direction and a node still holding the old value is running
 * at exactly today's behaviour, so the next natural restart is soon enough — there
 * is deliberately no forced rebuild.
 *
 * ## Why this is NOT a `NodeLocalSnapshot` like its two siblings
 *
 * The trusted-owner anchor (`trusted-owner-store.ts`) and the cold-start
 * bootstrap-peer store (`bootstrap-peer-store.ts`) are the same `{ version,
 * partyId, ... }` envelope over a {@link DurableSlot} this record is, and this
 * module is deliberately symmetrical with them — same injected-backend shape, same
 * `Memory*` / `Persistent*` / `File*` split, same party scoping. It does NOT share
 * their `NodeLocalSnapshot` machinery, for two reasons:
 *
 *  - **Shape.** `NodeLocalSnapshot` is a `key -> entry` map. This record is one
 *    integer that must be able to go DOWN after a machine is removed.
 *  - **Load policy — the important one.** `NodeLocalSnapshot.open` THROWS when the
 *    slot is present but unreadable. That is right for the anchor (a record that
 *    cannot be read in full is not a trust anchor) and right for the peer store (a
 *    failed read reported as absent would let the next snapshot write destroy a
 *    stranded node's only way home). It is WRONG here. Nothing in this record is
 *    trust-bearing, it holds nothing that is not recomputed the moment the control
 *    database is up, and refusing to start a node over an unreadable *repair hint*
 *    is strictly worse than declaring today's 2. So every unreadable, unparsable,
 *    foreign-party or junk slot LOGS and COLD-STARTS, yielding `undefined`, which
 *    declares nothing, which is byte-for-byte today's behaviour.
 *
 * Do not "unify" the three modules by routing this one through `NodeLocalSnapshot`:
 * that would quietly import the throw, and turn an unreadable hint into a node that
 * will not start.
 *
 * NOTE: writes are serialised in-process only, the same caveat `NodeLocalSnapshot`
 * carries. Two processes (or two browser tabs) sharing ONE slot for ONE party each
 * write their own view and the loser's count is lost. Two same-origin tabs of
 * `reference-app-web` do exactly that — its slot is one key of a shared IndexedDB
 * database, the same last-writer-wins caveat its `node-local-slots.ts` already
 * records for the other two records. Harmless here, unlike there: this value is one
 * integer both tabs re-derive from the same membership rows on their next refresh,
 * so the views reconverge rather than losing an entry nobody rewrites.

/**
 * push-fanout.ts — the server-side push-wake **trigger policy + fan-out**.
 *
 * The delivery half (`push-notifier.ts`) knows *how* to send one strand-wake to
 * one device; this module owns *who* to wake and *when*. On strand activity it
 * enumerates the cadre's hibernating mobile members, prefers a direct
 * control-network `pushWake`, falls back to FCM/APNs platform push only when the
 * direct dial cannot reach the (suspended) peer, and dedups/cooldowns per
 * `(peer, strand)` so a chatty strand cannot spam wakes.
 *
 * It owns no transport and no DB access: every node primitive (member
 * enumeration, participation check, direct dial, token resolve, stale-token
 * expiry) and the `PushNotifier` are injected, so the whole policy is unit-tested
 * with fakes and never throws to its trigger (a dropped wake is recoverable — the
 * hibernation check-in wake is the backstop).
 *
 * Cross-platform-clean by construction: it imports only the `PushNotifier`
 * *type* (erased at emit) and the dependency-free `STRAND_WAKE_TYPE` value, so it
 * carries no `node:http2`/`node:crypto` edge. The Node-only notifier is built by
 * `CadreNode` (via a guarded dynamic import) and injected here.

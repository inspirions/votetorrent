        //
        // Re-running the WHOLE `exec` after a partial failure is safe, and this is the
        // non-obvious part:
        //
        //  - `apply schema` is a DIFF, not a replay. Quereus collects the live catalog, diffs
        //    the declared schema against it, and only emits DDL for what is missing — which is
        //    exactly why `initialize` hydrates persisted optimystic schemas BEFORE getting here.
        //    A table the live catalog already lists generates no statements at all, which is what
        //    makes an apply over an already-complete schema (a warm start) a no-op.
        //    NOTE: a table the catalog lists with DIFFERENT constraint text diffs to
        //    `alter table ... drop constraint`, which the optimystic module refuses, so a store
        //    written by a build with older constraint text fails here on every start (policy:
        //    recreate, docs/architecture.md after the Control Network table). If backwards
        //    compatibility becomes a requirement, this apply is the migration site.
        //  - a failed apply is taken back WHOLE (Quereus 4.20.0). The migration loop keeps an
        //    undo journal; when a step fails it runs that journal in reverse, re-renders the
        //    catalog, compares it against a fingerprint taken BEFORE the apply, and only then
        //    rethrows the step's own error. So attempt 2 does not resume where attempt 1 died —
        //    it re-emits the whole schema, because the catalog is back where the apply started.
        //
        // Together: attempt 2 emits exactly the DDL the live catalog is missing, whatever
        // attempt 1 reached. No `if not exists` juggling, no per-table loop, no statement
        // splitting.
        //
        // That second bullet carries a dependency the pre-4.20.0 argument did not have. The
        // unwind Quereus performs is the CATALOG's; whether STORAGE follows it is the optimystic
        // plugin's doing. Quereus runs the forward steps, the undo steps and the verification
        // all inside the module's `beginSchemaBatch`/`endSchemaBatch` pair, and the plugin puts
        // each undo statement (`drop table`, `drop index if exists`) through its ordinary hooks
        // in that one write batch, then commits the restored state. On a plugin build WITHOUT
        // those batch hooks storage would be left holding objects the catalog no longer lists,
        // and the re-run would diff against a catalog that disagrees with the blocks. So this
        // argument is a statement about the pair, not about Quereus alone — pinned by
        // `test/control-schema-apply-unwind.spec.ts`.
        //
        // Only the "cohort did not answer, nothing committed" class is retried; the classifier
        // vetoes indeterminate commits and does not match `Missing block`, which is a durable
        // convergence fault a retry cannot heal (tracked separately) and must keep propagating.
        // The cases the unwind cannot cover — a failed undo statement, a post-unwind catalog
        // that does not match its fingerprint, an irreversible step — are retried deliberately
        // rather than vetoed; why, on `RETRIABLE_SCHEMA_INIT_MATCHERS`.
        //

    /**
     * One UNRETRIED drain of a control read to rows — every read in this class bottoms out
     * here (almost all via {@link readRows}, which adds the transient-failure retry), and
     * this is the ONE place the committed-read opt-in is spelled.
     *
     * Reached only through {@link readRows}, which drops straight here for the call sites
     * that pass `retry: false` — reads issued from INSIDE a locked write body, where a
     * backoff sleep would hold the write lock and the write funnel re-runs the read anyway
     * (see the NOTE on {@link readRows}).
     *
     * A control read normally queues on the database's exec mutex, so it does not answer
     * until whatever statement holds that mutex finishes. When a control WRITE is parked
     * against an unresponsive cohort member that is minutes, and a read that only wants
     * the last committed state waits the whole time for no reason
     * (`complete/control-reads-blocked-by-stalled-write`).
     *
     * Quereus's remedy is `readConcurrency: 'committed'` — a PER-CALL opt-in
     * (`Statement.tryRouteConcurrent` refuses anything that did not ask for it by name)
     * that runs an eligible read off the mutex against each table's last committed state.
     * Routing is best-effort and never an error: an ineligible statement falls back to
     * the serialized path silently — any side-effecting node, any table-valued function
     * call (pure ones included), any table whose module does not declare
     * `readCommittedSnapshot`, or an EXPLICIT transaction being open on this database.
     *
     * **It is asked for only while a write is in flight, and that condition is the whole
     * point.** The opt-in does not merely move the read off the mutex: it connects the
     * table with `_readCommitted`, and the optimystic vtab serves such a connection from
     * a pinned pre-transaction snapshot that NEVER refreshes from the network, where an
     * ordinary read calls `update()` on the collection first. Taking that path
     * unconditionally therefore trades "reads block behind a stalled write" for "reads
     * stop seeing what other machines wrote" — measured, not theorised: with every read
     * opted in, `control-write-degraded-cohort-member` could no longer observe a sibling
     * publishing its own `CadrePeer` row and failed at suite setup on two runs out of two.
     *
     * "A write is in flight" is {@link writeInFlight}, and it needs TWO signals because a
     * write is invisible to `getAutocommit()` for part of its life. `Database.exec` takes
     * the exec mutex first; the implicit transaction — the moment `getAutocommit()` turns
     * false — opens only after the write has acquired the mutex, planned the statement,
     * and awaited `begin()` on every connection. While the write WAITS for the mutex (a
     * serialized read holds it, say) it still reports autocommit, so a read routed on
     * `getAutocommit()` alone queued behind the write and answered only after its whole
     * commit — tens of seconds against a slow cohort member, which is what timed out the
     * degraded-cohort scenario's `isMember` read (verified against the engine directly;
     * `complete/control-read-queues-behind-a-write-waiting-for-the-database`). So an
     * UNLOCKED read also takes the committed path while any locked write body is running
     * ({@link runningWriteBodies}), which covers that queued window and everything else a
     * body does before its transaction opens. A read issued INSIDE a locked body
     * (`underWriteLock`) must not: that body is the one being counted, and its guard reads
     * need the refreshing path — so it keeps the transaction-only test.
     *
     * Both signals are sampled synchronously just before `eval`, which claims its place
     * on the mutex in that same tick, so the only race left is a body starting or ending
     * in between: a body that starts after the sample queues its statements BEHIND this
     * read, and one that ended before it has nothing left to queue behind.
     *
     * Residual gaps, both of which still queue a read behind a write:
     * - an EXPLICIT transaction ({@link inTransaction}) disqualifies the committed path in
     *   Quereus itself, so a read overlapping such a body's `COMMIT` falls back to the
     *   serialized path and waits for it;
     * - a writer that bypasses {@link withWriteLock} is not counted (in this repo only
     *   `reference-app-web`'s deliberately-rejected diagnostics insert does).
     *
     * What a committed read gives up is observing a write that has not finished
     * committing, and that is safe for every caller here: an AWAITED write is committed by
     * the time it returns, and a read inside {@link inTransaction} is disqualified by the
     * open explicit transaction and stays serialized, so it still sees its own
     * transaction's rows. A read after an UNAWAITED write on this database would be wrong
     * — no such caller exists, and {@link withWriteLock} is what keeps it that way.
     *
     * NOTE: counting whole bodies widens the stale (non-refreshing) window from "a
     * transaction is open" to "a locked body is running", which adds a body's pre-transaction
     * work and its post-commit tail (a `CadrePeer` write's membership-listener read). The
     * slow part of a write against a degraded cohort is its commit, already inside the old
     * window, so the added time is short; if a poller for replicated rows ever starves
     * behind back-to-back local writes, narrow the count to the span from a body's first
     * statement to its transaction opening.

     *
     * `retry: false` drops straight to {@link readRowsOnce}: reads issued from INSIDE a
     * locked write body must not retry on their own. `retryControlWrite`'s contract is that
     * backoff sleeps happen with NO lock held; a read retrying its own backoff inside a

     *

     * read runs CONCURRENTLY with a locked body, so `this`-state cannot tell the two apart,
     * and there is no async-context primitive available on every target platform (browser,

     * time. Authorized by the REAP branch of the table's `AuthorizedDelete`: the
     * tombstone is itself owner-signed (`Revocation.Authorized`), so no owner key is
     * needed HERE — any node holding row + tombstone may reap, drones included.
     *
     * Returns whether a row was removed: `false` without writing when the row is absent
     * locally (the common case on most nodes), or when its live stamp is not `stampId`
     * (a fresh incarnation the owner re-seated, which the old tombstone must not touch).
     *
     * The delete's WHERE clause binds `StampId` too — required, not belt-and-braces: an
     * owner may re-seat the row (fresh stamp) between the stamp read below and the
     * statement, and without the clause the reap would delete the owner's brand-new row.
     * With it the statement matches nothing and the reap is a silent no-op (the schema
     * branch would also refuse that delete, but as a constraint error thrown into a
     * background sweep — matched-nothing is the better failure mode). Like
     * {@link reauthorizeCadrePeer}, a race lost AFTER the guard still returns `true`;
     * harmless — nothing was deleted, and the next sweep re-reads.
     *
     * Writes NOTHING to `Revocation`: `RevocationRecorded` is satisfied by the same
     * committed tombstone that authorizes the reap, so a reap files no second tombstone.
     * It therefore does NOT fire the guarded-delete listener either — that seam exists to
     * queue a tombstone for re-issue when it committed while alone, and a reap has no
     * tombstone of its own to re-issue. A reap that commits while alone needs no
     * re-replication at all: every OTHER node either already lacks the row, or holds the
     * same committed tombstone and reaps its own copy.
     *
     * NOTE: the reap delete is keyed on the primary key; the `StampId` predicate is applied
     * where the statement runs. If a reap on one node ever has to be reconciled against an
     * owner re-seat of the same key that landed on another node, whether the delete or the
     * re-seat wins is decided by the collection's merge order, not by this clause — the same
     * ordering question the owner-signed delete path already carries
     * (`tickets/blocked/forked-control-collection-sync-livelocks.md`). Only matters once a
     * sweep drives this automatically on connected nodes; if that reconcile ever drops a
     * freshly re-seated row, this is the site.

     * `table` and its {@link GUARDED_KEY_COLUMN} column come from closed literal unions —
     * no caller-supplied string reaches the statement (same injection-surface discipline
     * as {@link deleteGuardedRow}). The `with context` clause is PRESENT and bound to
     * nulls, never omitted: Quereus cannot resolve `context.OwnerKey` at plan time when
     * the clause is absent while a constraint references `context.*` (nulls through a
     * present clause are the shape {@link redeemInvitation}'s consent-branch insert ships).

     * that converged on a removal while holding the removed row keeps that row as inert

     * control connection (a reap is a write, and a write committed alone is local-only).
     *
     * Enumerated UNLOCKED, deleted per-row LOCKED: {@link reapRevokedRow} takes the write
     * lock itself (via {@link mutateCadrePeer} / {@link execWrite}) and the lock is not
     * re-entrant, so this loop must not hold it. Same structure as
     * `CadreNode.reissueAuthoredMembershipRows`.

     * Two rows are deliberately left alone:
     *
     * - **Tables outside {@link REAPABLE_TABLES}** (`Strand`, `StrandPartyKey`, `OwnerKey`)
     *   — no reap branch exists on their `AuthorizedDelete`, so the delete would throw
     *   rather than no-op.
     * - **This node's OWN `CadrePeer` / `DeviceToken` row** (`selfPeerId`). Reaping it would
     *   fight this node's own re-registration: `registerSelf` / `retouchSelfDeviceToken` run
     *   on the heartbeat and the growth drain, and after a self-reap their insert-if-absent
     *   guard takes the INSERT path — which needs an owner signature `NotRevoked` refuses for
     *   a retired stamp, and which a revoked drone cannot produce at all. The trade is
     *   recurring failure noise every cycle against removing the one stale row nobody else
     *   reads from this node (every other node already filters it by tombstone). A revoked
     *   node therefore keeps its own copy of its own row; "a node that learns it has been
     *   revoked should shut itself down" is a distinct behaviour and its own ticket.
     *   `ValidationKey` and `JoinedStrand` have no self notion and are not special-cased.
     *
     * A per-row failure is logged and skipped rather than aborting the sweep: an abort would
     * starve every tombstone after the failing one on every subsequent pass, and each row is
     * independent. Returns the count so far if the database is closed mid-sweep.
     *
     * `selfPeerId` is a parameter rather than read from the injected libp2p node so the
     * skip-self rule is exercisable without one.
     *
     * NOTE: cost is O(tombstones), not O(live rows) — one {@link queryRevocations} scan plus
     * one {@link queryStampId} point lookup per tombstone, and the empty early return makes
     * the common case (a party that has never revoked anyone; {@link queryRevocations} skips
     * the ledger marker) a single scan per pass. That scan consults the cohort on every pass
     * only while `Revocation` has never been written; the ledger marker
     * ({@link openRevocationLedger}), filed by the same connected pass, makes it a held block.
     * But `Revocation` is append-only and unbounded, so this is O(all tombstones ever) point
     * lookups on every reconcile tick. Fine while revocations stay rare for a cadre-sized
     * party; if the table ever grows, persist a node-local high-water mark of what has
     * already been reaped instead of re-scanning everything (the same bound the sweep in
     * `CadreNode.drainPendingRevocations` wants).

 * Backend-agnostic store for raw private key material.

 * peer/node identity key and (in the single-key reference model) the owner
 * signing key derived from it. This module defines the seam those keys flow
 * through so a platform-secure backend (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore) can be
 * plugged in without `@serfab/cadre-core` taking any platform dependency.
 *
 * This file is dependency-free (no node:/RN imports) so it is safe in every
 * entry graph. The Node reference {@link FileKeyStore} lives in a separate
 * subpath module (`./key-store-file.js`) so its `node:fs` import never lands in
 * the cross-platform default entry.

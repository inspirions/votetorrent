/**
 * Control-network strand-address RPC.
 *
 * A strand runs as its own libp2p node (`strand-<id>`, random port), separate
 * from the control node (`control-<partyId>`), with its own transport peerId
 * derived from the cadre identity key (`strand-transport-key.ts`). To seed a
 * strand's mesh, a node needs a sibling's **strand-network** address — but
 * `CadrePeer.Multiaddr` only stores the **control** node's addresses, and a
 * control address now names a different peer entirely, not merely a different
 * port. This protocol resolves the strand address on demand: a node asks its
 * connected co-cadre siblings "what are your live strand-`X` multiaddrs?" and
 * uses the union of their answers as the seed.
 *
 * Modeled directly on `strand-wake-protocol.ts`: a dedicated libp2p protocol id,
 * 4-byte big-endian length-prefixed JSON frames, `node.handle` for the receiver,
 * `node.dialProtocol` for the client, and the shared `ControlStream` primitives
 * from `control-stream.ts`. The exchange is a single request → single response on
 * one stream, so each side reads to EOF (under a read timeout) and decodes one
 * frame via the shared {@link decodeLengthPrefixedFrame} guard.
 *
 * **Authorization (v1):** like wake, the receiver defers entirely to the injected
 * `isMember` predicate and requires no further signature; a peer it rejects gets
 * a `refused` reply with no addresses. `CadreNode` injects its AUTHORIZED-membership predicate
 * (`isAuthorizedMember`: voucher on the requester's `CadrePeer` row verified
 * against the node-local trusted-owner anchor), so an outsider that published its
 * own rows into the replicated control DB cannot harvest live strand addresses.
 * Cross-party strand bootstrap is a different mechanism (strand formation /
 * `MemberPeer`) and is out of scope here.

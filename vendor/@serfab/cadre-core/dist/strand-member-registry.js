 *
 * The {@link StrandAdmission} chosen at construction selects which branch of

 * compatibility but writes target this db's `Strand.*` tables.
 *
 * NOTE: `peerIds` are NOT written as `MemberPeer` rows here. The signed peer path
 * now exists as the standalone `registerMemberPeer` writer (each peer self-proof is
 * signed by the member's own key), but wiring the enrollment `peerIds` through it is
 * a deliberate follow-on — the member self-proof available here does not carry the
 * per-peer signatures `MemberPeer.Authorized` requires. A non-empty `peerIds` is

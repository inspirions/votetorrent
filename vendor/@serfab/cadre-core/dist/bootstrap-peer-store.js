/**
 * Node-local, NON-replicated bootstrap-peer store: dial targets a node learned
 * out of band, kept so it can dial those peers when nothing better is known.
 * Two sources feed it:
 *
 *  - **A seed's owner peers.** A newcomer applies a signed seed nominating the
 *    party's owner machines and the addresses they answer on.
 *    `SeedBootstrapService.applySeed` dials those owners exactly once,
 *    best-effort; when that dial fails (owner briefly down, relay reservation not
 *    up, not yet vouched) the node has an empty `CadrePeer` table and no
 *    connection, and `CadreNode.reconcileControlCohort`'s cold-start branch is
 *    the only way back — it re-dials these retained addresses every pass.
 *  - **Nodes this node added.** `CadreNode.addDrone` is handed the added node's
 *    addresses, but that node's `CadrePeer` row stays unsigned, and therefore
 *    unresolvable, until the node self-publishes — which needs a connection, and
 *    a node that cannot listen (a phone) is never dialed by it. The steady-state
 *    reconcile pass falls back to these addresses for a sibling whose signed
 *    record and address-book entry both yield nothing, including after a
 *    relaunch that outlived the record's freshness window.
 *
 * Held only in memory, either kind dies with the process and the node is left
 * with no address to dial, which is what this store exists to prevent.
 *
 * Three implementations, mirroring `trusted-owner-store.ts` (read that first —
 * it solves the same "must outlive the process, storage differs per platform"
 * problem, the two stores are deliberately symmetrical, and both persistent
 * forms share `node-local-snapshot.ts`):
 *  - {@link MemoryBootstrapPeerStore} (this module, cross-platform) — ephemeral;
 *    the default when no store is injected via `CadreNodeConfig.bootstrapPeers`.
 *  - {@link PersistentBootstrapPeerStore} (this module, cross-platform) — durable
 *    over any `DurableSlot` the embedding app supplies (IndexedDB, a LevelDB KV,
 *    SQLite, …).
 *  - `FileBootstrapPeerStore` — the above over a Node file in the node's state
 *    directory; Node-only, behind the subpath
 *    `@serfab/cadre-core/bootstrap-peer-store-file` (same isolation pattern as
 *    `key-store-file`) so `node:fs` never lands in the RN/browser entry graph.
 *
 * **Nothing here is trust-bearing, and a loader must not try to re-verify it.**
 * Only *dial targets* are retained — never a seed, a signature, or an authority
 * claim. A seed was signature-checked against the node-local trusted-owner
 * anchor before its addresses were retained, and an added node's addresses were
 * supplied by the owner that chose to add it. Either way a dial grants no
 * authority: `CadreNode.bootstrapDialAddrs` binds every address to the peer id it
 * was retained under, so a dial cannot be redirected to whoever answers. What a
 * persistent backend's loader DOES owe is dropping structurally junk entries
 * (unparseable peer id, empty address list, non-string address) rather than
 * carrying them into the dial loop.

/**
 * Node-only file-backed {@link StrandPeerBookStore}: one JSON file per party under
 * a configured directory (the node's state directory — `cadre-cli` passes
 * `ResolvedConfig.nodeStateDir`), holding the node-local, non-replicated strand
 * peer book (the strand peers this node has met, with their last-known addresses).
 *
 * Nothing but the file itself lives here: the envelope, load policy, per-entry
 * validation, the merge rule and the serialised snapshot writes are cross-platform
 * in `PersistentStrandPeerBookStore` / `node-local-snapshot.ts`, and the file is a
 * `FileDurableSlot`. This module exists only so the `node:fs` edge stays out of the
 * package's cross-platform default entry (`./index.js`) — import it from the
 * dedicated subpath instead:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { FileStrandPeerBookStore } from '@serfab/cadre-core/strand-peer-book-file';
 * ```
 *
 * Same isolation pattern as `bootstrap-peer-store-file.ts` / `key-store-file.ts`.

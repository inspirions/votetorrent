/**
 * strand-id.ts — the only places cadre-core mints a strand id.
 *
 * A strand id is not just a key in the control database: it is the strand's storage
 * scope key (a directory, a LevelDB filename, an IndexedDB database name — whatever
 * the embedder's provider makes of it) and the strand node's libp2p network name,
 * `strand-<id>`, which becomes the protocol prefix `/optimystic/strand-<id>`. It also
 * replicates to every other node in the party, which will turn it into those same
 * names on their own disks.
 *
 * So a generator that emits a shape `isValidStrandScopeKey` rejects does not fail
 * here — it fails later, on a peer, at launch. Minting in one module and asserting the
 * predicate on the way out is what keeps that impossible: a future edit to either shape
 * fails at its own call site rather than on someone else's machine.

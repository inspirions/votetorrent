/**
 * push-notifier-apns.ts — APNs HTTP/2 strand-wake delivery.
 *
 * Node-only: signs a provider JWT (ES256, JOSE raw r‖s via `node:crypto`) and
 * sends a background data push over an HTTP/2 session to Apple's gateway. APNs
 * mandates HTTP/2, so `node:http2` is unavoidable here — one reason the push
 * path is injected rather than rebuilt on WebCrypto/`fetch`.
 *
 * Reachable only through the `@serfab/cadre-core/push-node` subpath — never from
 * the cross-platform `./index.js` graph — so the `node:crypto` / `node:http2`
 * imports below are safe: no RN/browser bundler ever resolves this module. (Plain
 * named imports; the old namespace-import-to-only-warn dance is obsolete now that
 * the module is unreachable from a browser build by construction.)
 *
 * The HTTP/2 call is behind an injected `Http2Requester` seam (bundled with a
 * `close` into an {@link ApnsTransport}) so unit tests assert the request shape
 * and map every documented response code with no real network and no credentials.
 * The default transport owns a single lazily-(re)established `node:http2` session.
 *
 * Two single-shot retries guard transient failure without a retry storm: a
 * thrown transport error (session death / GOAWAY mid-send) re-establishes the
 * session and retries the one request once; a 403 `ExpiredProviderToken`
 * re-mints the provider JWT and retries once. A second failure is returned as-is.
 *
 * Secret hygiene: the `.p8` `privateKey`, the minted JWT, and full device tokens
 * are never logged — failure log lines carry only a status/reason and a redacted
 * token prefix.

 * different inputs never yield names equal ignoring case. The escapes keep

 * 0600), fsync'd, then atomically renamed onto `finalPath`. A failure at any
 * point removes the temp file and leaves the previous file untouched.
 *
 * `tmpPath` must be a sibling of `finalPath` (same directory) so the rename
 * stays within one filesystem and is therefore atomic, and should carry a
 * random component so concurrent writers (and crash-orphaned leftovers) are
 * collide-free.
 *
 * Durability bar: the temp file is fsync'd before the rename so a power loss
 * cannot surface a file whose bytes never reached the platter, and `dir` is
 * fsync'd afterwards (best-effort — see {@link syncDirBestEffort}) so the
 * rename itself survives a crash. On POSIX `rename(2)` replaces atomically;
 * Node maps to `MoveFileEx(MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)` on Windows, which is
 * also atomic — though it can fail with `EPERM`/`EBUSY` if another process
 * holds the destination open. That cross-process case is out of scope for the
 * single-flight in-process callers here; such a failure surfaces to the caller
 * with the previous file left intact.

/**
 * Delegate-peer admission grants for a party control node that also runs the
 * circuit-relay server.
 *
 * A strand node runs as its own libp2p instance with its own transport peerId,
 * derived from the cadre identity key + strandId (`strand-transport-key.ts`).
 * That derivation uses the member's PRIVATE seed by design, so no third party —
 * including a co-cadre relay — can recompute it: a sibling's relay sees an
 * unknown peerId it has no way to place as a member.
 *
 * The resolution (docs/strands.md → "Relay willingness"): a party control
 * node running a relay is party-private infrastructure — it relays for its own
 * party's nodes, including the extra transport identities its members' strand
 * nodes run as. The mechanism is a **member-announced delegate grant**: before
 * a member's control node starts a strand node, it tells its siblings (over the
 * already-authenticated `/sereus/strand-addr/1.0.0` RPC) the derived peerId
 * that strand node will use, and the receiver holds a short-lived, in-memory
 * admission grant for exactly that peerId. The grant is consulted by the
 * connection-level gate (`CadreNode.admitInboundControlConnection`) and by the
 * relay-reservation admission (`CadreNode.admitControlRelayReservation`) — a
 * granted delegate is admitted outright, never drawing on the small
 * unauthorized-reservation budget that unplaced peers share
 * (`membership-connection-gater.ts` → "The relay-reservation seam") and never
 * racing its not-reserving connection deadline. The fail-closed per-stream gate
 * (`authorizeInboundControlStream`) never honors a grant, so a delegate gets
 * the connection and its reservation (all a circuit-relay `hop` needs) and
 * nothing more.
 *
 * A grant is a delegation of trust to an already-trusted member: the receiver
 * cannot verify that the announced peerId really is the member's strand node,
 * so an authorized member can hand CONNECTION-level access to a peerId of its
 * choosing for up to {@link DELEGATE_GRANT_TTL_MS}. The caps below bound how
 * far a buggy or compromised member can stretch that.
 *
 * The receiver side is {@link DelegateAdmissionStore}. The announcer side keeps
 * its own throttle state (a "last announced at" map that `CadreNode` owns) and
 * decides from it, per reconcile pass, which relays are due a re-announce —
 * {@link dueRelayAnnounces} and {@link prunePeerStrandKeys} are that
 * decision, pure and testable, kept here beside the TTL they are derived from.

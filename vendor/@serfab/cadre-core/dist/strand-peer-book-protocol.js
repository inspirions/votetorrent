/**
 * The strand peer book SWAP protocol, `/sereus/strand-peers/1.0.0`, on the STRAND
 * libp2p node: when two strand peers connect, each sends the other the signed
 * entries of its strand peer book (`strand-peer-book.ts`) — its own current
 * addresses, self-signed, plus the freshest signed entry it holds for every other
 * peer of the strand — and merges what comes back. That closes the two gaps the
 * node-local book alone leaves: a peer whose relay reservation or address ROTATES is
 * known to the others by its old address only until they happen to reconnect, and in
 * a strand of three or more parties a late joiner holds an address only for the party
 * that invited it. After one swap it holds everyone's.
 *
 * Wire shape, modeled on `strand-addr-protocol.ts`: 4-byte big-endian length-prefixed
 * JSON frames over one stream, one request → one response, the shared
 * `control-stream.ts` primitives, a read timeout and a concurrency cap on the
 * receiver, and a {@link MAX_BOOK_FRAME_SIZE} cap on what either side buffers.
 * Request and response are the same {@link StrandPeerBookFrame}. Only SIGNED entries
 * ever travel: an entry this node observed or a formation carried is its own
 * observation, not the peer's statement, and is never forwarded.
 *
 * ── Whose signature ──
 *
 * Each entry is signed by the named peer's own STRAND TRANSPORT key
 * (`strand-transport-key.ts`, the key its strand libp2p node runs under), over the
 * canonical JSON of `{ v: 1, strandId, peerId, addrs, issuedAt }`. Verification needs
 * no key exchange: an Ed25519 libp2p peer id embeds its public key, so any receiver
 * checks that the entry for peer X was signed by X. NOT the strand member key, for
 * four reasons:
 *
 * 1. Open strands have no shared member key at all, and the book has to work there.
 * 2. A member-key signature proves only "some member said this", so any member could
 *    forge another member's address and cost every peer a 16 s relayed dial per
 *    launch; a self-signature is a claim only the named peer can make.
 * 3. On a closed strand the member key is shared by every machine of a party, so it
 *    cannot identify a machine anyway.
 * 4. Membership is a separate question, judged at the connection by the revocation
 *    gate today (`strand-revocation-enforcer.ts`) and by the allowlist later
 *    (`feat-strand-member-allowlist-admission`); this protocol rides that gate
 *    (`node.handle` → `authorizeInboundStream` on a closed strand).
 *
 * **The book therefore proves "this peer's own claim about where it is", never "this
 * peer is a member of the strand".** An address grants no authority (the dialed peer
 * authenticates by peer id at the handshake), so the worst a forged or stale entry
 * costs is a failed dial, and a self-signature is exactly what bounds who can impose
 * that cost on whom.
 *
 * ── Clocks ──
 *
 * `issuedAt` is the signer's clock. It is compared only between entries from the
 * SAME signer (the store's merge rule), so skew between machines is harmless — except
 * that a far-future stamp would pin an entry forever, hence the
 * {@link STRAND_PEER_ISSUED_AT_SKEW_MS} ceiling (reject and log). The store ages an
 * entry from `max(issuedAt, lastSeenAt)`, so a signer far in the past ages out fast,
 * which is the right failure for a machine with a broken clock.

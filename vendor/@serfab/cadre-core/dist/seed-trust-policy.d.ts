/**
 * Trust-anchor policy for control-network seeds.
 *
 * A seed carries an ed25519 signature over its body and the `signerKey` that
 * produced it. Verifying that signature only proves the seed is internally
 * consistent — it does NOT prove the signer is an owner, because both the
 * signer key and the seed's own `isOwner` peer flags are attacker-supplied.
 * The trust decision must therefore rest on an anchor that does not come from
 * the seed body:
 *
 *  1. Anchored — keys in the receiver's NODE-LOCAL `TrustedOwnerStore`: the
 *     non-replicated, per-party record of owner keys established out of band
 *     (founding the party, the `CadreInvite` that enrolled this node, an
 *     operator pin). Deliberately NOT the replicated `CadreControl.OwnerKey`
 *     table — any connecting node can genesis-insert its own key there and let
 *     it replicate, so that table can be made to say "yes" by a stranger.
 *  2. Pinned out-of-band — keys handed to the node for this seed only (carried
 *     by a `CadreInvite.ownerKeys`, or pinned by an operator) without having
 *     been anchored yet.
 *  3. TOFU (opt-in) — an explicit confirmation callback invoked on first sight
 *     of an unknown signer key. Interactive hosts only; off by default.
 *
 * Secure default (`anchoredTrustPolicy`): a node with an empty anchor and no
 * pinned keys rejects the seed — a seed can no longer vouch for its own signer,
 * and neither can a polluted replicated table.
 *
 * A key accepted via anchor 2 or 3 is reported back through
 * {@link SeedTrustDecision.anchorAs} so `applySeed` can persist it into the
 * node-local anchor, and later seeds from the same owner are accepted without
 * re-supplying the invite/confirmation.

 * loop mechanics (jittered capped backoff, budget checked after a failed attempt BEFORE
 * sleeping, last error rethrown unchanged) are deliberately identical so a fix to one
 * cannot silently miss the other.
 *
 * The log prefix is part of the policy because the write funnel's lines are asserted
 * byte-identically by `control-write-degraded-cohort-member.integration.ts` — extracting

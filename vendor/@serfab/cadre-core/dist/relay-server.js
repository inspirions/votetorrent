/**
 * The circuit-relay SERVER a party-run node runs — whether it runs one, and with which
 * `@libp2p/circuit-relay-v2` init — resolved once from `NetworkConfig` for both node
 * kinds: the control node (`cadre-node.ts` → `buildControlNodeOptions`) and every strand
 * node (`strand-instance-manager.ts` → `buildStrandRuntime`). One function decides both
 * answers so the two build sites cannot drift apart.
 *
 * WHY cadre sets an init at all. libp2p's server defaults `applyDefaultLimit` to true,
 * which stamps every reservation with `Limit { data: 128 KiB, duration: 2 min }`; libp2p
 * marks each connection relayed under it "limited" and resets it once either cap is
 * reached, and db-p2p's database protocols refuse a limited connection outright (they do
 * not set `runOnLimitedConnection`). A party-run relay exists to carry that party's own
 * database traffic, so the cap cut off every sync and chat history forwarded through it
 * (gotchoices/sereus#19). The dedicated relays (`ops/docker/libp2p-infra`, and the
 * `startDedicatedRelay` test fixture that stands in for it) already turn the limit off;
 * this is the same policy for the party-run kind.

/**
 * Default size of a party-run relay's reservation store, raised from libp2p's 15.
 *
 * A NAT'd machine reserves one slot for its control node and one for each strand it
 * serves, all on the same relay (`strand-network-config.ts` hands strand nodes the
 * control node's `network.relayAddrs`), so the store needs
 * `NAT'd machines × (1 + strands each)` slots. At libp2p's 15, three phones serving four
 * strands each already fill it. 128 covers, for example, ten NAT'd machines serving eleven
 * strands each with the unauthorized-reservation budget's 8 slots
 * (`MAX_UNAUTHORIZED_RELAY_RESERVATIONS`) still free on top — one party's worth, where the
 * dedicated relay's 500 is sized for many parties. A reservation costs the server a map
 * entry and a timer, not a connection's worth of state, so the headroom is cheap.

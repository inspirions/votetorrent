/**
 * The timer seam shared by the strand bring-up loops that re-arm themselves one step at a
 * time — the first-sync write gate's probe loop (`strand-first-sync-gate.ts`) and the
 * membership reconciler's retry ladder (`strand-membership-reconciler.ts`). `setTimeout`
 * rather than a repeating interval because the next step is armed only once the previous
 * one settles, so a slow network read never stacks steps behind it, and because the delay
 * can differ per step.
 *
 * Tests inject a hand-cranked clock; production omits it and gets real timers, `unref`'d so
 * a loop that is only waiting never holds a Node process open (the call is optional —
 * browsers and React Native return a plain handle with no `unref`).

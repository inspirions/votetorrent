/**
 * The per-strand driver of the strand peer book SWAP (`strand-peer-book-protocol.ts`
 * has the wire format, the signatures and the reasons): one of these per running
 * strand, armed on the strand's libp2p node right after it exists and released with
 * it, so a hibernation wake re-arms one on the rebuilt node. It owns three things:
 *
 * - **This node's own signed entry.** Built from the node's own bound addresses
 *   (`dialableAddrs`, the binding the observer applies to a remote), stamped with the
 *   local clock, signed with the strand transport key, and filed in the book under
 *   the node's own peer id. Signed at arm time and RE-SIGNED whenever the address set
 *   changes — `self:peer:update`, debounced because a relay reservation landing fires
 *   it more than once — which is what makes a rotation propagate. An unchanged
 *   address set is deliberately not re-signed on a timer: freshness is about change,
 *   and a periodic re-sign would only make every peer rewrite its slot.
 * - **The receiver**, registered through `node.handle` so a closed strand's revocation
 *   gate judges every inbound stream first.
 * - **The exchanges.** One when a strand peer is identified (the same `peer:identify`
 *   + `speaksBlockTransfer` gate the observer and the peer-join catch-up use, plus
 *   "lists the swap protocol", so an older node is skipped rather than dialed),
 *   throttled to one per peer per {@link STRAND_PEER_BOOK_SWAP_THROTTLE_MS}; and one
 *   with EVERY connected strand peer whenever the own entry is re-signed, unthrottled,
 *   so a rotation reaches everyone while connections are up. Both sides do this, so
 *   one connection produces two small exchanges; accepted as simpler than electing an
 *   initiator. A failed exchange is logged, never fatal, and never retried before the
 *   throttle expires.
 *
 * What lands in the book: the sender's own statement is filed as seen now (there is a
 * live connection to it); a forwarded third party's is filed as never seen, so it ages
 * from the signer's `issuedAt` alone. The store's merge rule does the rest — a signed
 * entry displaces an unsigned observation, and between two signed the greater
 * `issuedAt` wins — so a stale forward never displaces a fresher statement already
 * held. The seed and refresh read the book unchanged: a forwarded third party is
 * dialed like any other peer, and a rotated peer's newer addresses displace its old.
 *
 * The own entry the node SENDS is the in-memory one, never re-read from the store, so
 * the store's aging cannot lose it; the stored copy is a record for diagnostics and
 * the seed's self-skip. Nothing here throws into a libp2p event handler.

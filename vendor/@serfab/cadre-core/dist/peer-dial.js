/**
 * Dialing one peer from a list of candidate addresses, so that an address that
 * never answers cannot use up the time the others needed.
 *
 * libp2p's own multi-address dial (`libp2p.dial(addrs)`, libp2p 3.1.3's
 * `DialQueue.dialPeer`) tries the addresses ONE AT A TIME under ONE signal, with
 * no time limit per address. An address whose connection attempt is silently
 * dropped — a firewall, a subnet the dialer cannot route to, a virtual adapter's
 * address a Windows host reports alongside its real ones — holds that dial until
 * the whole signal expires, and every address sorted after it is never tried. It
 * also sorts the list itself (`defaultAddressSorter`), putting loopback addresses
 * last, behind exactly the LAN addresses most likely to be dropped. A phone
 * borrowing a node from a cadre-host whose only reachable address was the
 * forwarded loopback one never connected for this reason.
 *
 * So the addresses are dialed here, each as its own `dial()` with its own time
 * limit ({@link PeerDialBudget.perAddressMs}), inside a limit for the whole peer
 * ({@link PeerDialBudget.totalMs}). One address per call also means libp2p's
 * sorter has nothing to reorder, so the order is chosen here
 * ({@link directBeforeRelayed}).
 *
 * Dependency-free apart from `control-stream.ts`, so any module may import it
 * without creating an import cycle.

 * Default limit on ONE address's dial attempt, in ms, at the DEFAULT declared link round trip:
 * `RELAYED_DIAL_ROUND_TRIPS` (4) x `DECLARED_LINK_ROUND_TRIP_MS` (3500 ms) plus the called
 * machine's `ADMISSION_DECISION_TIMEOUT_MS` (2000 ms) = 16 000 ms (`relayedDialBudgetMs`). It
 * was a fixed 8000 ms before it was derived.
 *
 * It has to cover the slowest address that should succeed, because an attempt
 * that needs longer fails the same way on every retry. That is a relayed dial on
 * a mobile link: connect to the relay (transport, encryption and multiplexer
 * handshakes, when no relay connection is open yet), open the circuit, then run
 * both handshakes again end to end through the relay. `link-budget.ts` is where that
 * reasoning is now a measured count instead of an estimate — four link round trips, measured at
 * 12 094 ms on a link whose round trip is 3 s — so the value MOVES with a host's
 * `NetworkConfig.linkRoundTripMs` rather than pinning the band this node can reach to whatever
 * number was typed here. A direct dial that works is far quicker — a phone's WebSocket dial to
 * a node forwarded over `adb reverse` measured 1.6 s end to end.
 *
 * Deriving it rather than leaving it fixed is deliberate: at 8000 ms fixed, the per-address
 * limit — not libp2p's own 10 s dial timeout — was the first thing to cut a relayed dial off,
 * from about 1000 ms of one-way link delay upward. Nothing said so, and a reader raising
 * `DEFAULT_CONTROL_COHORT_DIAL_TIMEOUT_MS` below would not have found it.
 *
 * NOTE: a `/p2p-circuit/webrtc` address also negotiates a WebRTC session after
 * the relay leg. If such dials are ever seen failing at exactly this limit, raise
 * the declared link round trip (or `network.controlCohort.perAddressDialTimeoutMs` on the
 * affected nodes) rather than the per-peer limit, which cannot help an address that is itself
 * cut off.
 *
 * Override per node with `network.controlCohort.perAddressDialTimeoutMs`.

 * depends on how many addresses the peer happens to report. Callers dial peers
 * one after another (the control-cohort reconcile pass dials each sibling in
 * turn), so that cost also delays every later peer. With the limit, a reconcile
 * pass costs at most (dialed siblings) × this.
 *
 * Sized to fit a typical list with dead addresses ahead of the one that works:
 * a lent cadre-host node reports two to four addresses a phone can dial
 * (loopback and LAN WebSocket addresses, plus any virtual adapters). So it is

 * whose working address sits behind four or more dropped ones does not fit, and fails each pass
 * the same way; if that shows up, the remedy is ordering (try the address that last connected
 * first), not a larger number here.
 *
 * Counted as whole per-address budgets rather than the flat 30_000 it was before, because the
 * old number left only 6 s after three dropped addresses — enough for the 1.6 s direct dial the
 * phone measured, but NOT for the relayed dial the per-address limit is sized to cover. A peer
 * whose only working address was a relayed one behind two dead ones therefore could not be
 * dialled at all, and the arithmetic in this comment was what said otherwise.

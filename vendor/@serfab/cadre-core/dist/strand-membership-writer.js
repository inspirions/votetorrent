 *
 * The `ConsumedInvite` insert carries an `InviteSignature` over
 * `InviteKey || '|' || MemberKey`, proving the consumer holds the invite private
 * key (the on-engine `ValidUsage` gate). The `Member` insert needs no member
 * signature — its admission is the existence of the matching `ConsumedInvite` —
 * but still mints a fresh StampId (NOT NULL on every path; a revoked-then-
 * re-invited member is a fresh incarnation under a fresh stamp).
 *
 * Single-use: `ConsumedInvite`'s primary key is `InviteKey`, so a second consume
 * of the same invite is rejected by the PK (a distinct layer from the control
 * network's `FormationUsage` single-use, which gates strand FORMATION, not the
 * per-strand member join enforced here).
 *
 * Expiry: the `ConsumedInvite.NotExpired` deferred check rejects redeeming an invite
 * whose `Expiration` is at or before `context.Now`. `Now` is supplied here as a
 * canonical-datetime string from `canonicalDatetime(db, nowMs)` — the SAME transform
 * `issueInvite` uses to store `Invite.Expiration` — so both sides of the schema's
 * `I.Expiration > context.Now` comparison are byte-identical canonical strings and
 * the lexical `>` orders chronologically at any granularity. (This intentionally
 * diverges from the control layer, which passes `Now` as a JS ISO string; Quereus
 * does not coerce context params, so an ISO `Now` would be compared lexically against
 * the canonical, T-separated `Expiration` and could mis-order near-same-instant
 * timestamps (due to a trailing `.000Z` suffix). The control tests only use far-future/far-past expiries, so that latent
 * skew never bites there — the strand layer avoids it outright.) A null `Expiration`
 * never expires. Like `ValidUsage`, `NotExpired` defers to commit, so an expired
 * invite rolls back the whole txn — neither the `Member` nor the `ConsumedInvite`
 * row survives.
 *
 * @param db - The closed strand's database.

 *   are safe once inserts are — every accepting branch requires a `Manager` row
 *   in the post-image, and the promotion branch's generation ordering keeps
 *   attacker rows out of it. The stamp binding is what makes a captured removal

 *   does not match — closing the removal half of
 *   `bug-strand-manager-authority-antireplay` (the insert half was already
 *   closed by the generation-bearing promotion payload).
 * - **Self-resignation** (`byManagerKeyPair` IS the target): the former-manager
 *   self branch verifies `digest('Strand.Manager', 'resign', old.MemberKey,
 *   old.StampId)` against `old.MemberKey` itself. The distinct `'resign'` tag is
 *   belt-and-braces (different verifying keys); the anti-replay fix is the stamp.
 *
 * The caller selects the case purely by which keypair it passes; the only
 * branching here is the action tag, chosen by comparing the signer to the target.

 * as INSERT by Quereus plus the Optimystic vtab session — enforcement lives above
 * the transactor (proven on the network transactor by
 * `strand-membership-network-transactor-parity.spec.ts`), so `Manager.Authorized`
 * — deferred — IS enforced here: a signer that is neither an existing manager nor
 * the target itself is rejected at commit.
 *
 * THE SOLE MANAGER CANNOT ORDINARILY RESIGN — it SEALS instead. The `'resign'`
 * branch of `Manager.Authorized` requires at least one manager in the POST-delete
 * image, so a resignation that would empty the `Manager` table is schema-rejected;
 * emptying it deliberately is a distinct, self-signed act — {@link sealStrand} —
 * that permanently freezes admission. This writer refuses the sole-manager
 * self-resignation up front with an error naming `sealStrand`; that TS guard is UX,
 * not the trust boundary — the schema rejects a mis-counted `'resign'` approval
 * regardless. Reading the count inside a caller-joined transaction is correct: an
 * add-then-resign hand-off composed in one transaction sees 2 and passes, while
 * the already-rejected delete-then-add swap sees 1 and is refused here as well as
 * by the schema. The bootstrap branch of `Manager.Authorized` is gated to INSERTs
 * (`old.MemberKey is null`), so it does not waive the signature check on a delete
 * that drops the count toward zero: a second-to-last removal is authorized
 * exactly like any other.
 *
 * HAND-OFF ORDER: a sole manager transferring control must ADD the successor FIRST
 * and resign SECOND. A same-transaction delete-then-insert swap is rejected — the
 * bootstrap branch is gated to the founding state (at most one `Member`), and the
 * successor's insert has no other manager to authorize it once the sole manager's
 * row is gone.
 *
 * Cross-node caveat: the `'resign'`/`'seal'` branches count rows visible to THIS
 * transaction, so two nodes concurrently removing different managers can each see
 * a survivor and still converge to zero — an unintended seal. Noted in the schema
 * (the `Manager` table's seal-propagation NOTE); a cross-node floor is not

 * has retired at least one `Manager` stamp into `Strand.Revocation`.
 *
 * All three conjuncts are load-bearing:
 * - `Header.Type` — an OPEN strand never holds `Manager` rows at all
 *   (`Manager.OnlyClosed`), so a bare manager-count test would report every open
 *   strand as sealed.
 * - the manager count — sealing IS the empty `Manager` table.
 * - the retired `Manager` stamp — "sealed" means admission is frozen FOREVER, and
 *   what makes it permanent is the founding branch of `Manager.Authorized`
 *   refusing to re-seat a generation-0 manager once any `Manager` stamp has been
 *   retired. Without this conjunct a closed strand that is merely NOT FOUNDED YET
 *   reads as sealed: {@link bootstrapFounderMembership} commits `Header`,
 *   `Member` and `Manager` as three sequential statements, so the window between
 *   the first and the last is exactly "closed, zero managers, still foundable".
 *
 * Reads locally visible rows — a node that has not yet converged on the seal
 * still reports `false` (the schema's seal-propagation NOTE).
 *
 * @param db - The strand's database.
 * @returns `true` iff the strand is closed, holds zero `Manager` rows, and has
 *   permanently closed its founding branch.

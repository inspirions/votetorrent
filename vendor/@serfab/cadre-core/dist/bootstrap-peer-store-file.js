/**
 * Node-only file-backed {@link BootstrapPeerStore}: one JSON file per party under
 * a configured directory (the node's state directory — `cadre-cli` passes
 * `ResolvedConfig.nodeStateDir`), holding the node-local, non-replicated dial
 * targets learned out of band (a seed's owner peers, and nodes this node added).
 *
 * Nothing but the file itself lives here: the envelope, load policy, per-entry
 * validation (shape only — never signatures; see the `bootstrap-peer-store.ts`
 * module comment for why nothing persisted here is trust-bearing) and the
 * serialised snapshot writes are cross-platform in
 * `PersistentBootstrapPeerStore` / `node-local-snapshot.ts`, and the file is a
 * `FileDurableSlot`. This module exists only so the `node:fs` edge stays out of
 * the package's cross-platform default entry (`./index.js`) — import it from the
 * dedicated subpath instead:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { FileBootstrapPeerStore } from '@serfab/cadre-core/bootstrap-peer-store-file';
 * ```
 *
 * A React Native / browser entry graph never resolves this path, so the
 * `node:fs` edge never reaches a bundler that cannot satisfy it (same isolation
 * pattern as `trusted-owner-store-file.ts` / `key-store-file.ts`).

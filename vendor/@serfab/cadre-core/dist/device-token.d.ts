/**
 * Device-token record helpers: the single source of truth for the bytes a node
 * signs when publishing its own `DeviceToken` row and re-verifies when resolving
 * another peer's row.
 *
 * Modeled directly on {@link peerRecordSignedPayload} (peer-record.ts): the signed
 * payload is a single SHA-256 digest over the shared domain-tagged field vector
 * (see control-authorization.ts) — the crypto plugin's injective multi-field
 * encoding, so no field split is ambiguous even with an opaque platform token. It
 * is intentionally NOT JSON-canonicalized (deterministic across node/browser/RN,
 * no key ordering) and is reconstructable inside the `DeviceToken.AuthorizedUpdate`
 * SQL constraint from the row's own columns:
 *
 *   digest('CadreControl.DeviceToken', 'publish',
 *          new.PeerId, new.Platform, new.Token, cast(new.UpdatedAt as text))
 *
 * Keep {@link deviceTokenSignedPayload} and that constraint byte-for-byte in sync.
 * The `'publish'` action tag marks this as a peer's SELF-signed record (signed with
 * the peer's own key, not an owner key) and keeps it disjoint from every
 * owner-signed digest.
 *
 * Unlike a peer-address record, a device-token record carries NO public key: the
 * signature is verified against the `CadrePeer.PublicKey` bound to the same PeerId
 * (the resolver supplies it), so the key binding is checked exactly once, where the
 * membership row already lives.
